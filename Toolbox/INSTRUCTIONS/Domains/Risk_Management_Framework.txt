RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK - WINGMAN OPERATIONAL MEMORY
================================================================================

**CALLSIGN:** Risk Manager (Wingman sub-system)
**PURPOSE:** Core risk calculations loaded into Wingman memory at session start
**APPLIES TO:** Every trade, every entry, every exit
**STATUS:** PERMANENT - Load at start of EVERY session
**LAST UPDATED:** 2025-10-27

================================================================================
CORE ACCOUNT PARAMETERS (SACRED - NEVER VIOLATE)
================================================================================

**Account Balance:** $23,105.83 (From account_state.json)
**Risk Per Trade:** 1% = $231.00 (FIXED)
**Daily Loss Limit:** $250.00 (Stop trading after this)
**Monthly Income Goal:** $2,500.00 ($125/day average)

**Constraints (From account_state.json):**
- Max equities: 70% of account
- Min cash: 10% of account
- Max crypto: 30% of account
- Max single position: 50% of account

================================================================================
POSITION SIZING FORMULA (MECHANICAL - NO JUDGMENT)
================================================================================

**Step 1: Calculate Risk Distance**
Risk Distance = Entry Price - Stop Price

**Step 2: Calculate Position Size**
Position Size = Risk Amount ÷ Risk Distance
Position Size = $231 ÷ (Entry - Stop)

**Example:**
Entry: $189.50
Stop: $188.20 (ATR-based, see below)
Risk Distance: $189.50 - $188.20 = $1.30
Position Size: $231 ÷ $1.30 = 177.69 shares → 177 shares

**Capital Required:** Position Size × Entry Price = 177 × $189.50 = $33,542.50

**Check:** Do we have enough cash? If not, reduce position size proportionally.

================================================================================
STOP LOSS CALCULATION - 4 METHODS
================================================================================

**METHOD 1: ATR-BASED (PRIMARY - USE THIS FOR MOST TRADES)**

Formula: Entry Price - (1.5 × ATR)

What is ATR?
- Average True Range over 14 periods
- Measures volatility
- Higher volatility = larger stops
- Lower volatility = tighter stops

Calculation:
1. Calculate True Range for last 14 bars:
   TR = MAX(High - Low, ABS(High - Close[1]), ABS(Low - Close[1]))
2. Average the 14 TRs
3. Result = ATR(14)

Example:
Entry: $189.50
ATR(14): $0.87
Stop: $189.50 - (1.5 × $0.87) = $189.50 - $1.305 = $188.195 → $188.20
Risk: $1.30 per share

**Why ATR-based?**
✓ Adapts to market volatility (tight in calm, wide in chop)
✓ Prevents whipsaws (not too tight)
✓ Scientific, not emotional
✓ Works across all timeframes

---

**METHOD 2: STRUCTURE-BASED (SECONDARY - CROSS-CHECK)**

Logic: Place stop just below recent support (for longs) or above recent resistance (for shorts)

Example:
Entry: $189.50 (breakout above resistance)
Recent Swing Low: $188.20 (support level)
Stop: $188.20 - $0.05 (one tick below) = $188.15
Risk: $1.35 per share

**Why Structure-based?**
✓ Based on actual price history
✓ Respects support/resistance zones
✓ Institutions watch these levels
✓ More intuitive

**How to use BOTH:**
1. Calculate ATR-based stop ($188.20)
2. Check recent structure support ($188.20)
3. If they align → Strong stop location
4. If they differ → Use structure if tighter, ATR if tighter

---

**METHOD 3: TIME-BASED (TACTICAL - INTRADAY ONLY)**

Logic: Exit if no progress toward target within X minutes

Example:
Entry: $189.50 at 9:45 AM
Time Limit: 15 minutes
Checkpoint: 10:00 AM
If price hasn't moved toward T1 ($191.45) by 10:00 AM → Exit for small loss

**When to use:**
✓ In highly choppy markets (6,650-6,700 box)
✓ Indecision zones
✓ Low-volume periods
✗ Don't use in trending markets

**Risk:** $231 (same as normal stop)

---

**METHOD 4: PERCENTAGE-BASED (NOT RECOMMENDED - BACKUP ONLY)**

Formula: Entry × (1 - Risk %)

Example:
Entry: $189.50
2% stop: $189.50 × (1 - 0.02) = $185.71
Risk: $3.79 per share (TOO LARGE - avoid)

Example:
Entry: $189.50
0.5% stop: $189.50 × (1 - 0.005) = $188.55
Risk: $0.95 per share (TOO TIGHT - whipsaw risk)

**Why not use?**
✗ Ignores volatility (ignores market context)
✗ Ignores support/resistance (wrong levels)
✗ Mechanical without basis

**Only use if:**
- ATR data unavailable
- Extreme market conditions
- Backup calculation

================================================================================
TARGET CALCULATION - SYSTEMATIC 3-TIER SYSTEM
================================================================================

**SYSTEM 1: RISK/REWARD RATIO (PRIMARY - USE THIS)**

Formula:
T1 = Entry + (Risk × 1.5)   [Take 50% profit here]
T2 = Entry + (Risk × 2.5)   [Take 30% profit here]
T3 = Entry + (Risk × 4.0)   [Let runner, trail stop]

What is "Risk"?
Risk = Entry Price - Stop Price

Example:
Entry: $189.50
Stop: $188.20
Risk per share: $189.50 - $188.20 = $1.30

T1: $189.50 + ($1.30 × 1.5) = $189.50 + $1.95 = $191.45
T2: $189.50 + ($1.30 × 2.5) = $189.50 + $3.25 = $192.75
T3: $189.50 + ($1.30 × 4.0) = $189.50 + $5.20 = $194.70

**Exit Plan with 177 shares:**
T1 @ $191.45:
  - Exit 50% (88 shares) = 88 × $1.95 = +$171.60
  - Remaining: 89 shares @ breakeven stop

T2 @ $192.75:
  - Exit 30% (26 shares) = 26 × $3.25 = +$84.50
  - Remaining: 63 shares (runner)

T3 @ $194.70 or stop hit:
  - 63 shares @ profit or small loss
  - Potential: +$261 or breakeven

**Total Potential:**
Best case (all targets hit): +$171.60 + $84.50 + $261 = +$517.10
Conservative (T1+T2 + T3 breakeven): +$171.60 + $84.50 + $0 = +$256.10
Worst case (all stopped): -$231.00

---

**SYSTEM 2: FIBONACCI EXTENSIONS (CROSS-CHECK)**

Use when:
✓ Clear swing low and high visible
✓ Fibonacci extensions align with resistance
✗ Don't use if no clear swing structure

Formula:
T1 = Entry + (1.618 × Swing Range)
T2 = Entry + (2.618 × Swing Range)
T3 = Entry + (4.236 × Swing Range)

Example:
Swing Low: $186.00
Swing High: $189.00
Swing Range: $3.00

T1: $189.50 + (1.618 × $3.00) = $189.50 + $4.85 = $194.35
T2: $189.50 + (2.618 × $3.00) = $189.50 + $7.85 = $197.35
T3: $189.50 + (4.236 × $3.00) = $189.50 + $12.71 = $202.21

**How to use both:**
- Calculate R:R targets (primary)
- Calculate Fibonacci targets (secondary)
- If they align: Confidence higher
- If they differ: Use primary R:R targets

---

**SYSTEM 3: STRUCTURE LEVELS (CROSS-CHECK)**

Use when:
✓ Previous swing highs/lows visible
✓ Round numbers (e.g., 190.00, 195.00)
✓ Multi-timeframe resistance zones

Example:
Recent swing high: $191.45 → Good T1 target
Previous major high: $193.20 → Good T2 target
Next major resistance: $195.00+ → Good T3 target

**How to use:**
1. Set R:R targets (primary)
2. Check if structure levels align
3. If targets near structure: Confidence higher
4. If targets in white space: Adjust down slightly

================================================================================
RISK/REWARD MINIMUM STANDARDS
================================================================================

**Minimum R:R Ratio:** 1.5:1
- You must risk $1 to make $1.50
- Below 1.5:1 → DO NOT TRADE

**Example:**
Entry: $189.50
Stop: $188.50 (risk $1.00)
T1 required: $189.50 + (1.5 × $1.00) = $191.00
Ratio: 1.5:1 ✓ ACCEPTABLE

Bad example:
Entry: $189.50
Stop: $188.00 (risk $1.50)
T1 only: $190.20 (profit $0.70)
Ratio: 0.47:1 ✗ REJECT

================================================================================
POSITION SIZING WITH CASH CONSTRAINTS
================================================================================

**Scenario: Insufficient Cash**

If capital required > available cash:
1. Reduce position size proportionally
2. Adjust risk accordingly
3. Don't use margin (stay at 1% risk)
4. Skip trade or wait for cash

Example:
Entry: $189.50
Stop: $188.20
Risk: $231 (1%)
Position: 177 shares
Capital needed: $33,542.50
Available cash: $23,105.83 ✗ INSUFFICIENT

Solution:
Max shares: $23,105.83 ÷ $189.50 = 121.87 → 121 shares
Adjusted risk: 121 × $1.30 = $157.30 (0.68% account)
New capital: 121 × $189.50 = $22,919.50 ✓ WITHIN BUDGET

**Decision:** Proceed with 121 shares, note reduced risk in entry record

================================================================================
DAILY LOSS LIMIT ENFORCEMENT
================================================================================

**Daily Limit:** $250.00

**How it works:**
1. Start day with $0 P/L
2. Each loss subtracts from limit
3. At -$250, Wingman BLOCKS new entries
4. Can close existing positions to recover
5. Limit resets at next trading day

**Example Sequence:**
Trade 1: -$50 (Daily: -$50, remaining: $200)
Trade 2: +$150 (Daily: +$100, remaining: $250)
Trade 3: -$75 (Daily: +$25, remaining: $250)
Trade 4: -$200 (Daily: -$175, remaining: $75)
Trade 5: -$80 (BLOCKED - would exceed $250 limit)

**If Blocked:**
- Close position if possible to recover
- OR wait until next trading day
- OR request override (logged for analysis)

================================================================================
LEVERAGE & MARGIN (NOT RECOMMENDED)
================================================================================

**Current Status:** DO NOT USE MARGIN

**Why?**
✗ Amplifies losses (lose more than account)
✗ Adds complexity (margin calls, forced exits)
✗ Unnecessary (1% risk per trade sufficient)
✗ Violates "sustainable income" goal

**Exception:** Only if:
- Swing trading multi-day positions
- Need higher capital deployment
- Deep analysis done on margin requirements
- Always: 2× conservative risk (0.5% instead of 1%)

================================================================================
RULE COMPLIANCE - RISK CHECKS
================================================================================

**Before EVERY entry, verify:**

❑ Risk = $231 (1% of $23,105)?
  If not, adjust position size

❑ Stop calculated (ATR or structure)?
  If not, calculate it now

❑ Targets calculated (1.5R, 2.5R, 4.0R)?
  If not, calculate them now

❑ R:R ratio >= 1.5:1?
  If not, SKIP this trade

❑ Cash available for position?
  If not, reduce size or skip

❑ Daily loss limit not exceeded?
  If yes, STOP for the day

❑ Position size mathematically correct?
  Double-check: Risk ÷ Stop Distance = Position

❑ Capital required within budget?
  Position Size × Entry = Capital Required

❑ All stops/targets set in broker?
  If not, set them before market execution

**If ANY check fails:** DO NOT ENTER TRADE

================================================================================
EXAMPLE CALCULATION (COMPLETE WALK-THROUGH)
================================================================================

**Setup:** NVDA Long, Entry $189.50

**Step 1: Calculate Stop**
ATR(14) = $0.87
Stop = $189.50 - (1.5 × $0.87) = $188.20

**Step 2: Verify Structure**
Recent swing low: $188.20
Matches ATR stop ✓ Confidence high

**Step 3: Calculate Risk**
Risk = $189.50 - $188.20 = $1.30 per share

**Step 4: Calculate Position Size**
Risk target: 1% = $231
Position: $231 ÷ $1.30 = 177.69 → 177 shares

**Step 5: Calculate Capital Required**
177 × $189.50 = $33,542.50

**Step 6: Check Cash Available**
Available: $23,105.83
Required: $33,542.50
⚠️ INSUFFICIENT: Reduce position

**Step 7: Adjust Position**
Max shares: $23,105.83 ÷ $189.50 = 121.87 → 121 shares
New risk: 121 × $1.30 = $157.30
% of account: $157.30 ÷ $23,105.83 = 0.68%

**Step 8: Calculate Targets**
T1: $189.50 + ($1.30 × 1.5) = $191.45
T2: $189.50 + ($1.30 × 2.5) = $192.75
T3: $189.50 + ($1.30 × 4.0) = $194.70

**Step 9: Verify R:R**
Risk: $1.30
Reward (T1): $1.95
Ratio: 1.5:1 ✓ MEETS MINIMUM

**Step 10: Verify Rules Compliance**
✓ Risk = 0.68% (within 1%)
✓ Stop calculated (ATR-based)
✓ Targets calculated (R:R system)
✓ R:R >= 1.5:1 ✓
✓ Cash available ✓
✓ Daily loss limit not exceeded ✓

**READY TO ENTER: 121 shares @ $189.50, stop $188.20**
