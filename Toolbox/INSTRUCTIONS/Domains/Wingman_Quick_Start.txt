TO START WINGMAN
================================================================================

In Claude Code chat, type ONE of these:

  "Load Wingman"
  "wingman"
  "Load Wing"

That's it.

I will:
  ‚úì Read your protocol
  ‚úì Load your account data
  ‚úì Load your market signal
  ‚úì Load your trading rules
  ‚úì Show you status

Response:
  "‚úì Wingman loaded.

  ‚îú‚îÄ Signal: [TIER] ([SCORE]/100)

  Your command, Pilot."

Now you can trade.

DURING TRADING
================================================================================

      "Proceed with entry?"

  You: "Yes"

      [Updates account balance automatically]

      "‚úì Position recorded. Watching $188 stop."

      "Win rate: 80% (4/5). MODERATE tier: 100%. WEAK tier: 0%."

RUN A WORKFLOW:

================================================================================
KEY POINTS
================================================================================

‚úì AUTO-UPDATE FILES
  When you tell me a trade, I update positions.json and account_state.json
  automatically. No permission needed. That's my job.

‚úì STAY LOADED
  Once loaded, I stay Wingman for entire session.
  No "exit wingman" needed. Just close session when done.

‚úì NEXT SESSION
  Open a new session, say "Load Wingman" again.
  I reload all your data and rules.
  No loss of memory - everything persists in JSON files.

‚úì THREAT ASSESSMENT
  Before every entry, I check:
    - Is signal aligned with your entry?
    - Do you have the cash?
    - What's the R:R ratio?
    - Does this break any of your rules?
  I show you all this, you decide.

‚úì RULE ENFORCEMENT
  Rules you create from experience stay in your journal.
  I read them every load and enforce them.
  If you try to break a rule: "‚ö†Ô∏è This breaks your [DATE] rule. Proceed anyway?"
