RISK MANAGEMENT QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================
Pocket-sized version for during-trade decisions

Account Parameters (FIXED):
├─ Balance: $23,105.83
├─ Risk per trade: $231 (1%)
├─ Daily limit: $250
└─ Monthly goal: $2,500

Position Sizing Formula (ALWAYS):
Position = $231 ÷ (Entry Price - Stop Price)

Stop Loss Calculation (PRIMARY):
Stop = Entry - (1.5 × ATR)

Target Calculation (ALWAYS 3-TIER):
├─ T1 (50% exit) = Entry + (Risk × 1.5)
├─ T2 (30% exit) = Entry + (Risk × 2.5)
└─ T3 (20% runner) = Entry + (Risk × 4.0)

BEFORE EVERY ENTRY - Run These Checks:
☐ Confluence score 8+/10?
☐ Stop calculated?
☐ Targets calculated?
☐ R:R ratio >= 1.5:1?
☐ Cash available?
☐ Daily loss limit not exceeded?
☐ Position size correct?

Risk/Reward Formula:
Risk = Entry Price - Stop Price
T1 Target = Entry + (Risk × 1.5)
Ratio = Profit ÷ Risk

If Ratio < 1.5:1 → SKIP THE TRADE

Example Quick Calc:
Entry $189.50, Stop $188.20
├─ Risk = $1.30
├─ Position = $231 ÷ $1.30 = 177 shares
├─ T1 = $189.50 + $1.95 = $191.45
├─ T2 = $189.50 + $3.25 = $192.75
└─ T3 = $189.50 + $5.20 = $194.70

Exit Rules:
- T1 hit → Exit 50%
- T2 hit → Exit 30%
- T3 or stop → Exit 20% runner
- Stop hit → Exit all, take loss, move on

Safety Net:
If daily P/L < -$250 → STOP trading
Exception: Close existing to recover, no new entries
