================================================================================
STANDARDIZED COMMAND NAMING
================================================================================

All Wingman commands now follow "wingman [action]" pattern:
  - "wingman recon"    âœ“ (run all scrapers)
  - "wingman prep"     âœ“ (run research workflow)
  - "wingman dash"     âœ“ (update dashboard)

Legacy note: Earlier versions used "wingmap prep". This has been replaced
with the more intuitive "wingman prep" across all documentation.

If you accidentally say something close:
  - "wingman research" â†’ Ask: Did you mean "wingman recon" or "wingman prep"?
  - "wing prep" â†’ Ask: Did you mean "wingman prep"?
  - "prepare" â†’ Ask: Did you mean "wingman prep"?

================================================================================

================================================================================

  1. "wingman recon"              (2 min)   â†’ Fresh market data

After Close (4:00 PM):

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If Wingman seems confused:
  "Did you mean [COMMAND]?" = Wingman is asking for clarification
  â†’ Confirm the command you intended

If data is stale:
  "wingman recon"                â†’ Refresh all market data

If you need to reload context:
  "Load Wingman" or "i know kung fu" â†’ Full reload with session continuity

If a workflow fails:
  Check error message â†’ Report exact issue â†’ Wingman can retry or skip
