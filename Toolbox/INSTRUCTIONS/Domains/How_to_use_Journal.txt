Journal Workflow - End of Day Tracking
=======================================

Purpose
-------
Track daily execution, learn from outcomes, and build pattern recognition through consistent journaling.

Self-Contained System
---------------------
The Journal is a STANDALONE EXECUTION LOG. It operates independently from other workflows:
- Generates its own dashboard from Journal.md and account_state.json only
- No dependencies on master-plan.md, research workflows, or signal calculations
- Pure execution tracking for learning and accountability

**Data Flow:**
Trade execution → Journal.md (documented) → journal-dashboard.html (visualized) → patterns learned


WHEN TO UPDATE JOURNAL
-----------------------

**1. Pre-Market (4:00-9:30 AM ET):**
   - Review yesterday's EOD entry
   - Note overnight moves
   - Confirm today's setups from Daily Planner

**2. Midday Check-in (11:00-1:00 PM ET):**
   - Log any trades taken (entry price, size, thesis)
   - Note if key levels triggered
   - Brief status update (1-2 lines)

**3. End of Day (4:00-8:00 PM ET) - MANDATORY:**
   - Generate detailed daily journal in `Journal/Log-Entries/` (e.g., via ChatGPT using `Journal/Chat Log.md` template).
   - Integrate a summary/link to this detailed journal into `Journal.md`.
   - Timestamp: "YYYY-MM-DD (HH:MM PT)"
   - Deliver an explicit review: execution quality (what worked / what didn't), trade outcomes, P&L, and tomorrow's prep.



DATA SOURCES FOR JOURNAL ENTRIES
---------------------------------

**The journal system is self-contained. For EOD Review (to create entries in Journal.md), reference:**

1. **Journal/Log-Entries/YYYY-MM-DD_EOD_Wrap.md** (PRIMARY)
   - Detailed daily trading journal created via ChatGPT
   - Contains: trades, P&L, account snapshot, execution observations, improvements
   - Extract key insights, trade outcomes, P&L summary, and lessons learned

2. **Prior Journal.md entries (last 3-5):**
   - Identify recurring patterns, rule breaches, or improvements to reinforce

3. **Your broker account (ALWAYS VERIFY):**
   - Current cash & sweep vehicle balance
   - YTD P/L total
   - Today's P/L (final number)
   - This feeds the Account Overview dashboard metrics

4. **Journal/journal-dashboard.html → live preview (optional but recommended):**
   - After updating `Journal.md`, refresh the local dashboard
   - Confirms Account Overview, Latest Entry, and Previous Entries display correctly


JOURNAL ORGANIZATION
--------------------

**Structure (top to bottom):**

1. **Entry Template** (compact format at top)
2. **Log** (newest entries first - reverse chronological, summarizing/linking to detailed entries in `Log-Entries/`)
3. **Weekly Macro Playbook** (recurring section)
4. **Review Checklist** (weekly/monthly retrospective)

**Keep it scannable:**
- Use headers (##) for each EOD entry
- Bullets for all content (not paragraphs)
- Max 5 bullets per section
- Bold key terms (triggers, levels, tickers)
- Keep the standard bullet labels (`**Market Action & Signal:**`, `**Trades/P&L:**`, `**P&L / Balance:**`, `**Execution Review:**`, `**Trend Watch & System Intel:**`, `**Tomorrow Prep:**`) so the dashboard parser can slot content into the correct panels.


JOURNAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------

**Two-tier system:**

1. **Journal/Log-Entries/YYYY-MM-DD_EOD_Wrap.md** (Detailed Record)
   - Generated via ChatGPT using Chat Log.md template
   - Contains full trade details, P&L, account snapshot, observations, improvement ideas
   - Most granular level of tracking
   - Used for deep analysis and pattern recognition

2. **Journal/Journal.md** (Execution Log)
   - Permanent execution log (newest entries at top, reverse chronological)
   - Each entry summarizes key points + links to detailed journal in Log-Entries/
   - Feeds journal-dashboard.html for visual display
   - Searchable history for pattern recognition and learning

**Dashboard (journal-dashboard.html):**
- Reads only from: `Journal.md` and `account_state.json`
- No dependencies on other workflows or files
- Displays: Account Overview, Latest Entry (6 sections), Previous Entries (collapsible)


WORKFLOW STEP-BY-STEP
----------------------

**IMPORTANT - SELF-CONTAINED WORKFLOW:**
✅ **The JOURNAL workflow is completely independent.**
✅ No prerequisites - start immediately at end of trading day.
✅ No dependencies on other workflows (master-plan, research, etc).
✅ All data comes from: ChatGPT journal + broker account + Account Summary section.

**At End of Trading Day - JOURNAL WORKFLOW (start here):**

**Step 1: Download Daily Journal to Inbox Folder**
   - Throughout the day, use `Journal/Chat Log.md` template with ChatGPT
   - At EOD, download the completed detailed journal
   - **Save it to `Journal/Inbox/` folder** (e.g., `Journal/Inbox/2025-10-17_EOD.md`)

**Step 2: Move journal from Inbox to Log-Entries**
   ```bash
   python scripts/journal_ingest.py --source Journal/Inbox/YYYY-MM-DD_EOD.md --date YYYY-MM-DD --tag EOD_Wrap
   ```
   This moves the file to `Journal/Log-Entries/YYYY-MM-DD_EOD_Wrap.md`

**Step 3: Create Journal Entry in Journal.md**

**OPTION A: CLAUDE-ASSISTED (RECOMMENDED) - 2-3 minutes:**

   Ask Claude: "Read the detailed journal at `Journal/Log-Entries/YYYY-MM-DD_EOD_Wrap.md` and create a new journal entry at the top of `Journal.md` using the standard format. Also update `account_state.json` with the Account Snapshot values."

   Claude will:
   - Read the detailed journal (trades, P&L, account snapshot, observations)
   - Create properly formatted entry in Journal.md with all real values
   - Update account_state.json from Account Summary section
   - Ensures correct format and clean data extraction

**OPTION B: MANUAL - 5-10 minutes:**
   - Open `Journal/Journal.md`
   - Add a new entry at the TOP (newest first, reverse chronological)
   - Use this format:
     ```
     ---

     **End of Day Review - YYYY-MM-DD (HH:MM PT)** - [Link to Detailed Journal](Log-Entries/YYYY-MM-DD_EOD_Wrap.md)

     - **Market Action & Signal:** [Key price action, market drivers, execution environment]
     - **Trades/P&L:** [Trades executed, P&L total, what worked/didn't]
     - **P&L / Balance:** Daily P&L **[+/-$X.XX]** or **[+/-X.XX%]**
     - **Account Summary:**
       - Cash & Sweep Vehicle: $[XX,XXX.XX]
       - OVERALL P/L YTD: $[X,XXX.XX]
     - **Execution Review:** [Process adherence, mistakes, improvements]
     - **Trend Watch & System Intel:** [Patterns observed, recurring themes, learning notes]
     - **Tomorrow Prep:** [Key levels, catalysts, focus areas, setup checklist]
    ```
   - Pull data from:
     * Log-Entries detailed journal (YAML format) - trades, P&L, observations
     * **Your broker account for Cash & P/L YTD** (ALWAYS verify current balances)
   - Timestamp in PT format: "YYYY-MM-DD (HH:MM PT)"
   - Save `Journal.md`

   **IMPORTANT:** The **Account Summary** section feeds the dashboard's Account Overview metrics:
   - Current cash balance
   - YTD P/L total
   - Used to calculate win rate from daily P/L entries

**Step 4: Dashboard Verification (2 min)**
   - Serve the repo locally (e.g., `python -m http.server`) if not already running
   - Refresh `Journal/journal-dashboard.html` in the browser to verify:
       • Account Overview: Current balance, YTD P/L, daily P/L, and win rate display correctly
       • Latest Entry: Market/Trades/P&L/Execution/Trend/Tomorrow sections display with focus tags
       • Previous Entries: Collapsible history shows prior entries (default collapsed)
       • "As of" timestamps update on each panel
   - If any data looks stale or missing, check Journal.md for typos in section labels (must match exactly)

**Time commitment:** 5-10 minutes for integration into `Journal.md` (assuming detailed journal is already generated)


JOURNALING BEST PRACTICES
--------------------------

**Do:**
- ✅ Be honest (especially about mistakes)
- ✅ Focus on process, not just P&L
- ✅ Note what you did right (reinforce good habits)
- ✅ Keep entries brief (quality > quantity)
- ✅ Review weekly to spot patterns

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip EOD entries (consistency matters)
- ❌ Write novels (bullets only)
- ❌ Only journal losses (wins teach too)
- ❌ Blame externals (focus on controllables)
- ❌ Let journal fall behind (daily discipline)


REVIEW FREQUENCY
----------------

**Daily (EOD):**
- What happened today vs plan
- Trades executed
- Key lesson

**Weekly (Friday PM or weekend):**
- Review all 5 EOD entries
- Note recurring patterns
- Update "Memory Anchors" in Weekly Playbook
- Adjust setup criteria if needed

**Monthly:**
- Full journal scan
- Performance metrics (R multiples, win rate, DD)
- Process improvements to codify
- Update risk rules


AUTOMATION NOTES
----------------

**Currently manual:**
- Generating detailed daily journal in `Journal/Log-Entries/` (external step).
- Integrating summary/link into `Journal.md`.
- Extracting key takeaways from detailed journal for `Journal.md` summary.

**Could be automated (future):**
- Auto-generate detailed daily journal from chat log.
- Auto-summarize detailed journal and integrate into `Journal.md`.
- Auto-extract key insights and improvement ideas.

**Keep manual (for now):**
- The interaction with ChatGPT for detailed journaling.
- The final review and selection of key takeaways for `Journal.md` summary.
