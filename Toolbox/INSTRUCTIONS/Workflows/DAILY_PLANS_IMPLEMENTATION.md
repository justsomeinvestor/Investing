Get professional trade plans in your Command Center every single morning

---

## 🎯 What You're Building

A morning routine where:
1. **9:30 AM:** You tell Claude "Create daily trade plans"
2. **2 minutes:** Fully formatted plans appear in Command Center
3. **10:00 AM - 3:30 PM:** You execute trades from the plans
4. **4:00 PM:** You review performance

No manual work. No spreadsheets. Just ready-to-trade plans every day.

## 📋 The Daily Plan Format

Every plan has the same structure:

```
$TICKER TRADE PLAN 📈 📉

BULLISH PLAN: [Ticker] above [Level] | [Option If Applicable] 📈
T: [Target 1], [Target 2]  SL [Stop Loss]

BEARISH PLAN: [Ticker] under [Level] | [Option If Applicable] 📉
T: [Target 1], [Target 2]  SL [Stop Loss]

CONTEXT:
[1-2 sentences about recent price action]
[1-2 sentences about key levels]
[1 sentence about what would confirm breakout]

TODAY'S BIAS:
[1-2 sentences about which scenario more likely]
```

---

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 1: Define Your Watchlist

First, decide which tickers get daily plans:

**Primary (Core Watchlist):**
- SPX (S&P 500 Index)
- ES (S&P 500 Futures)
- QQQ (Nasdaq 100)

**Secondary (Individual Stocks):**
- NVDA, AAPL, TSLA, etc.

**Optional (Specialized):**
- VIX, SKEW, XLK, etc.

**Your Watchlist:**
```
Tell Claude: "My daily watchlist is: SPX, ES, QQQ, NVDA, AAPL"
Claude learns this and uses it every time
```

### Step 2: Set Up Command Center Panel

Add new panel to `Journal/command-center.html`:

**Panel Name:** "📊 Morning Trade Plans"
**Position:** Top of page, below signal cards
**Content:** Trade plans for your watchlist
**Update:** 9:30 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:30 PM ET

HTML structure (simplified):
```html
<div class="morning-trade-plans-panel">
  <h2>📊 Morning Trade Plans</h2>
  <div id="trade-plans-container">
    <!-- Plans populate here -->
  </div>
  <div class="last-updated">Generated: 9:30 AM</div>
</div>
```

### Step 3: Create Daily Routine

**9:30 AM (Every Trading Day):**
```
You: "Create daily trade plans for SPX, ES, QQQ"

Claude:
1. Loads research-dashboard.html
2. Extracts current prices
3. Identifies key support/resistance levels
4. Creates bullish scenarios with targets
5. Creates bearish scenarios with targets
6. Pulls context about recent price action
7. Assesses today's bias
8. Formats all plans
9. Displays in Command Center
```

Result: Plans ready to trade in 2 minutes

**12:00 PM (If Price Moved):**
```
You: "Update trade plans with latest data"

Claude:
1. Reviews if price moved significantly
2. Recalculates targets if needed
3. Updates stops if thesis requires it
4. Notes any changes
5. Updates Command Center
```

Result: Plans stay current

**4:00 PM (End of Day):**
```
You: "EOD trade plan review - which worked today?"

Claude:
1. Reviews each plan
2. Notes if bullish/bearish hit targets
3. Notes if stops were hit
4. Logs to journal for pattern analysis
5. Provides lessons for next day
```

Result: Performance tracked, system improves

### Step 4: Format Settings

Define how plans appear:

**Plan Density:**
- Compact: Ticker + Entry + Targets + Stop on 1-2 lines
- Full: Everything with context and bias assessment

**Context Length:**
- Brief: 3-4 sentences max
- Detailed: Full explanation of levels

**Option Information:**
- Include: Show call/put options for plays
- Skip: Just show price targets

**Display Order:**
- By conviction (most likely first)
- By ticker (SPX, ES, QQQ, NVDA...)
- By category (Indices, then Stocks)

### Step 5: Tracking Performance

Create simple tracking:

```
Daily Plan Performance Log:

SPX Plans This Month:
- Bullish Plans: 12 | Hit T1: 10 | Hit T2: 6 | Stopped: 2
- Bearish Plans: 8 | Hit T1: 5 | Hit T2: 2 | Stopped: 3

Best Performing: SPX Bullish with calls (83% hit rate)
Worst Performing: NVDA Bearish with puts (38% hit rate)

Action: Focus on SPX bullish, skip NVDA bearish
```

## 📐 KEY LEVEL EXTRACTION

How Claude identifies levels for each ticker:

### From Research Dashboard:
1. **Current Price** - Where price is trading now
2. **Weekly Range** - High/Low for the week
3. **Key Resistance** - Price rejected here multiple times
4. **Key Support** - Price bounced here multiple times
5. **Midpoint** - Often acts as swing support/resistance
6. **Volatility** - How far can price reasonably move today

### Example - SPX:
```
Current: 6645
Week High: 6762
Week Low: 6500
Resistance Levels: 6700, 6762
Support Levels: 6600, 6550
Midpoint: 6631
Typical Daily Range: 50-100 points
```

### Plan Creation:
```
BULLISH:
- Entry: 6640 (above midpoint + support)
- Target 1: 6700 (first resistance)
- Target 2: 6762 (week high)
- Stop: 6600 (support level)

BEARISH:
- Entry: 6600 (below support)
- Target 1: 6550 (second support)
- Target 2: 6500 (week low)
- Stop: 6640 (above midpoint)
```
