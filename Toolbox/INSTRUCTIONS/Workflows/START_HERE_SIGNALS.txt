WHAT YOU JUST GOT:
══════════════════

A complete, production-ready workflow that:

1. Reads your research-dashboard.html (all that data)
2. Extracts sentiment, consensus, trading levels, catalysts
3. Identifies your 3-5 best daily trade setups
4. Scores each on 5 dimensions (Technical/Consensus/Sentiment/Catalyst/Volume)
5. Creates a trading thesis for the day
6. Displays signal cards in your Command Center
7. Tracks which signals work vs don't (for continuous improvement)


CREATED FILES:
══════════════

📄 README_SIGNALS_WORKFLOW.md
   └─ Complete system overview (best to start here)

📄 SIGNALS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   └─ One-page cheat sheet for daily use

📄 RESEARCH_DASHBOARD_TO_SIGNALS_WORKFLOW.md
   └─ Detailed 5-step workflow guide

📄 SIGNAL_CARD_HTML_TEMPLATE.md
   └─ Copy-paste ready HTML for Command Center

📄 SIGNALS_SYSTEM_DIAGRAM.md
   └─ Visual data flow and architecture

📄 START_HERE_SIGNALS.txt
   └─ This file

🐍 scripts/research/extract_signals.py
   └─ Optional Python automation for data extraction


QUICK START (5 MINUTES):
═══════════════════════

1. Read: SIGNALS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md

2. Tell Claude:
   "Generate trading signals from research dashboard"

3. Claude will:
   - Load your research dashboard
   - Extract current sentiment and levels
   - Identify best 3-5 setups
   - Score each setup (0-100 quality)
   - Display signal cards in Command Center

4. You then:
   - Review the signal cards
   - Execute trades from the highest quality signals
   - Log trades to your journal
   - End-of-day: Review what worked


COMMAND TO RUN IT:
══════════════════

Morning (9:30 AM ET):
  "Generate trading signals from research dashboard"

Mid-day (12:00 PM ET):
  "Check research, any new signals?"

End-of-day (4:00 PM ET):
  "EOD signal review - what worked"

Anytime:
  "Rebuild thesis for [TICKER]"
  "Show me only strong signals (75+)"
  "Why is this signal weak?"


HOW IT WORKS:
═════════════

Each signal gets scored on 5 components from research dashboard:

  Technical (40%)     ← Chart pattern strength
  Consensus (20%)     ← % of providers bullish/bearish
  Sentiment (15%)     ← AI interpretation match
  Catalyst (15%)      ← Economic event timing
  Volume (10%)        ← Options/volume confirmation

Composite Score = Weighted Average (0-100)

Tiers:
  90-100: EXTREME   → Trade with full conviction
  75-89:  STRONG    → Trade with standard sizing
  60-74:  MODERATE  → Trade with reduced size
  45-59:  WEAK      → Avoid
  <45:    AVOID     → Don't trade


EXAMPLE SIGNAL CARD:
════════════════════

Score: 78          STRONG BUY
Setup: ES Long at 5650-5655

Technical   ██████████  85/100
Consensus   ████████░   73/100
Sentiment   ████████░   75/100
Catalyst    ███████░    70/100
Volume      ██████████  80/100

Entry: 5650-5655
Stop:  5640 (-10 points)
PT1:   5680 (+25 points)
PT2:   5700 (+45 points)
Risk/Reward: 1:3.5


WHERE SIGNALS DISPLAY:
