# Media & Catalysts Curation Logic

**Purpose:** Autonomous decision-making framework for curating the Media & Catalysts tab in master-plan.md during workflow execution.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03

---

## Core Principle

Only add items that provide **actionable trading intelligence** with clear conviction levels based on data-driven signals from existing system summaries.

---

## 1. INCLUSION CRITERIA (What Makes the Cut)

### üöÄ Upcoming Catalysts
**Add if:**
- Macro events from Economic Calendar with HIGH impact (NFP, CPI, FOMC)
- Earnings clusters (3+ mega-cap names same week)
- IPOs with >$1B valuation in relevant sectors (AI, crypto, semiconductors)
- Policy announcements flagged in X Macro with +200% velocity
- **Conviction threshold:** Must be dateable event with market-moving potential

### üí° Research Highlights
**Add if:**
- Tier 1/2 analyst calls (Jake Wujastyk, Trader Mayne, Raoul Pal) with specific levels/targets
- Technical setups with entry/stop/target defined
- Crowdsourced levels from X with 3+ influencers citing same price
- Sector rotation signals from provider consensus (e.g., 42 Macro sector calls)
- **Conviction threshold:** Analyst has track record (mentioned in provider summaries) + specific actionable thesis

### üìä Data Anomalies & Institutional Flows
**Add if:**
- Institutional deployments >$100M (like JPM $500M ‚Üí NMR)
- X velocity breakouts >+200% (like NFP mentions +250%)
- Options flow surges mentioned by johnscharts or similar
- Whale movements from CoinGlass/Whalemap summaries
- Stablecoin flows or custody announcements (like Walmart OnePay)
- **Conviction threshold:** Quantifiable flow data + potential copycat/precedent value

### üé• Must-Watch Content
**Add if:**
- YouTube videos with timestamp-specific insights (not generic market commentary)
- X threads from Tier 1 influencers with multi-tweet analysis
- Bloomberg/CNBC interviews with specific forecasts (like Solomon "drawdown" warning)
- **Conviction threshold:** Contrarian or high-conviction view vs consensus

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Exhaustion Signals
**Add if:**
- X velocity reversals <-50% (like ZEC -60% after +1200% spike)
- Sentiment extremes (X sentiment >90 = euphoria, <25 = capitulation)
- Hype cycle indicators from X analysis (excessive emojis + >35% extreme sentiment)
- Breadth divergence warnings from Market Breadth provider
- **Conviction threshold:** Signal must contradict current positioning (contrarian value)

---

## 2. SOURCE PRIORITY RANKING

When multiple items compete for limited slots, prioritize:

1. **X posts with permalinks** from known analysts (Jake, Trader Mayne, Pomp, Raoul)
2. **Economic Calendar HIGH-impact events** within 7 days
3. **RSS articles** with institutional announcements (mergers, partnerships, capital raises)
4. **YouTube videos** from monitored channels with recent upload (<48 hours)
5. **Aggregate X trends** (velocity, sentiment) as "Data Anomaly" items

---

## 3. CONVICTION LEVEL ASSIGNMENT

**HIGH:**
- Event with 99%+ probability (like FOMC Oct 29 with 99% cut probability)
- Analyst call with specific entry/stop/target AND historical win rate
- Institutional flow >$500M with price impact precedent
- X velocity >+300% AND dateable catalyst

**MEDIUM-HIGH:**
- Institutional announcement without confirmed dollar amount
- Technical setup from Tier 2 analyst with clear invalidation
- X velocity +200-300% with emerging narrative

**MEDIUM:**
- Sector rotation thesis from provider consensus (70-80% agreement)
- Crowdsourced levels (3-5 influencers citing same price)
- Exhaustion signal with -50% to -75% velocity reversal

**LOW:**
- Speculative thesis without clear catalyst timing
- Emerging narrative with <3 mentions in X data
- *(Note: Generally don't add LOW conviction items unless filling a gap)*

---

## 4. TAG ASSIGNMENT LOGIC

**Auto-tag based on content keywords:**

- "Fed", "FOMC", "rates" ‚Üí `macro`
- "BTC", "ETH", "crypto" ‚Üí `crypto`
- "support", "resistance", "breakout" ‚Üí `technical`
- "IPO", "earnings", "NFP", "CPI" ‚Üí `catalyst`
- "institutional", "$XXM", "custody" ‚Üí `institutional`
- "velocity", "sentiment >X%", "extreme" ‚Üí `sentiment`
- "exhaustion", "reversal", "-X%" ‚Üí `exhaustion`
- "AI", "semiconductors", "tech" ‚Üí `tech`
- "China", "geopolitical" ‚Üí `macro`
- "setup", "entry", "target" ‚Üí `setup`

Multiple tags allowed per item (max 4-5 for specificity).

---

## 5. LINK EXTRACTION RULES

### X/Twitter Posts:
1. Read latest `Research/X/Crypto/x_list_posts_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.json` or Macro/Technicals equivalent
2. Search for author or keyword in "text" field
3. Extract "permalink" field (e.g., "https://x.com/Jake__Wujastyk/status/1973873016007520522")
4. Use permalink as "link" value

**Example grep command:**
```bash
grep -i "Jake.*Wujastyk\|keyword" x_list_posts_*.json | grep -A5 "author"
```

### RSS Articles:
1. Read `Research/RSS/[Provider]/YYYY-MM-DD_[Title].md` file
2. Extract "Original URL" from line 6 of metadata header
3. Validate URL is not homepage (must contain article path)
4. Use specific article URL as "link" value

**Example:**
```
Line 6: - **Original URL**: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/specific-article-path.html
```

### YouTube Videos:
1. Read `Research/YouTube/[Channel]/YYYY-MM-DD_[VideoID]_[Title].md` file
2. Extract "Video URL" from line 5 of metadata
3. OR construct from video ID: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=[VideoID]`
4. Use video URL as "link" value

### Internal Dashboard References:
1. If no specific external source exists (aggregate data)
2. Use internal tab links: `#calendar`, `#crypto-tab`, `#macro-tab`, `#xsentiment-tab`, `#technicals-tab`
3. Only use as fallback when no external URL available

**CRITICAL:** Never use generic homepage URLs (e.g., https://www.cnbc.com/ or https://x.com/username without status ID)

---

## 6. BLURB WRITING FORMULA

**Structure:** [Context/Setup] + [Specific Insight/Thesis] + [Trading Implication/Action]

**3-Sentence Framework:**
1. **Setup (1 sentence):** What's happening technically/fundamentally
2. **Insight (1 sentence):** Why it matters (precedent, pattern, catalyst)
3. **Action (1 sentence):** What to watch/do (trigger, target, stop)

**Examples:**

‚ùå **Bad Blurb:**
"Jake Wujastyk tweeted about $BMNR looking good."

‚úÖ **Good Blurb:**
"Williams % Range breakout + symmetrical triangle apex + volume shelf = potential 10%+ day. Last two Williams breakouts preceded significant moves. Watch open >$60 as confirmation trigger."

‚úÖ **Good Blurb (Macro):**
"Chicago Fed President Goolsbee signals caution on pace of rate cuts despite 99% Oct 29 cut probability. Potential hawkish tilt vs dovish consensus. Watch for shift in Fed narrative post-NFP. If labor data strong + hawkish Fed = rate cut repricing risk."

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Use specific numbers (levels, percentages, dollar amounts)
- Include precedent or pattern recognition ("Last two times X happened...")
- End with actionable trigger or implication ("Watch for...", "If X then Y...")
- Keep total under 150 words (2-3 sentences max)
- Avoid generic statements ("bullish", "looks good") without specifics

---

## 7. QUANTITY GUIDELINES

**Per Category:**
- üöÄ Upcoming Catalysts: 3-5 items (next 7-30 days)
- üí° Research Highlights: 5-8 items (keep top 8, rotate old ones out after 7 days)
- üìä Data Anomalies: 3-5 items (keep fresh, archive after trade happens)
- üé• Must-Watch: 2-4 items (only if timestamp-specific value)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Exhaustion Signals: 1-3 items (only when signal active)

**Total Target:** 15-25 items across all categories

**Rotation Logic:**
- Items >7 days old with no new mentions ‚Üí archive
- Items where "trade already happened" ‚Üí keep as template but mark "[CLOSED]" in title
- Catalysts that passed ‚Üí remove unless outcome provides learning value
- Maintain most recent 5-8 items per category, archive rest

---

## 8. INTEGRATION WITH SYSTEM DATA

### Cross-Reference Before Adding:

**Step 1: Check X Summaries for velocity data**
- Read `Research/X/Crypto/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Crypto_Summary.md`
- Read `Research/X/Macro/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Macro_Summary.md`
- Read `Research/X/Technicals/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Technicals_Summary.md`
- Extract: Top narratives, velocity percentages, influencer calls, crowdsourced levels

**Step 2: Check Provider Summaries for confirmation**
- Jake Wujastyk call ‚Üí verify in `Research/RSS/` or `Research/YouTube/Trader Mayne/`
- Institutional flow ‚Üí verify in `Research/X/` or `Research/RSS/CoinDesk/`
- Technical levels ‚Üí verify in `Research/Technicals/TradingView BTC/` or `TradingView SPX/`

**Step 3: Check Signal System for context**
- Read `Research/.processing_log.json` ‚Üí `signal_calculations.composite_score`
- If adding bullish item + composite <50 ‚Üí flag conflict, explain contrarian view in blurb
- If adding bearish item + composite >70 ‚Üí flag conflict, explain contrarian view in blurb

**Step 4: Check Economic Calendar for event proximity**
- Read `Research/Macro/YYYY-MM-DD_Economic_Calendar_Summary.md`
- Don't add "upcoming catalyst" if event is <24 hours (it's already in "today" section of calendar)
- Do add if event is 2-7 days out (sweet spot for positioning trades)

---

## 9. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

### When Multiple Items Compete:

**Priority Order:**
1. Newer date > older date (Oct 3 > Oct 2)
2. Higher conviction > lower conviction
3. Specific permalink > generic source
4. Actionable thesis > commentary
5. Contrarian signal > consensus view (higher alpha potential)

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ KEEP: Jake $BMNR Oct 3 with permalink + specific level (Williams breakout + $60 trigger)
- ‚ùå ARCHIVE: Jake $BMNR Oct 2 generic mention (volume gap thesis without update)

### Handling Duplicates:

If same analyst + same ticker + same week:
1. Check if new information adds value
2. If yes: Update existing item with new permalink + date
3. If no: Keep existing item, skip new one

**Example:**
- Existing: "Jake Wujastyk: $BMNR Weekly Shelf Setup (Oct 2)"
- New: "Jake Wujastyk: $BMNR Breakout - Symmetrical Triangle (Oct 3)"
- Action: **Replace** old item with new (more specific setup, newer data)

---

## 10. RED FLAGS (Do NOT Add)

**Skip items if:**
- ‚ùå No specific thesis (vague bullishness/bearishness without levels or reasoning)
- ‚ùå No source link possible (can't extract permalink/URL to verify)
- ‚ùå Conflicts with composite signal without explanation (adds confusion, not clarity)
- ‚ùå Rehashes existing item without new information (creates duplicate noise)
- ‚ùå Low-tier influencer (<1K followers, not in provider list, no track record)
- ‚ùå Clickbait without substance ("Bitcoin to $1M by EOY!!!" without thesis)
- ‚ùå Already in provider tabs (don't duplicate insights that exist in crypto/macro/technicals tabs)
- ‚ùå Generic market commentary ("Markets look volatile" without specific trade setup)
- ‚ùå Retroactive analysis ("I called the top" without forward-looking trade)

---

## 11. WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### When Step 6 (Curate Media & Catalysts) Executes:

**Input Sources:**
1. Read latest X Crypto/Macro/Technicals summaries
2. Read latest YouTube provider summaries (past 48 hours)
3. Read latest RSS provider summaries (past 48 hours)
4. Read Economic Calendar summary
5. Read `.processing_log.json` for signal context

**Candidate Identification:**
6. Apply inclusion criteria to identify candidates:
   - Scan X summaries for velocity >+200% or <-50%
   - Scan provider summaries for analyst calls with specific levels
   - Scan RSS for institutional announcements (>$100M flows, partnerships, IPOs)
   - Scan Economic Calendar for HIGH-impact events <7 days out

**Curation Process:**
7. For each candidate:
   - Extract source link using rules (Section 5)
   - Assign conviction level using criteria (Section 3)
   - Write blurb using formula (Section 6)
   - Tag appropriately using keyword logic (Section 4)

**Prioritization & Selection:**
8. Rank candidates by priority (date, conviction, actionability)
9. Add top N items per category (follow quantity guidelines in Section 7)
10. Archive items >7 days old or where trade closed

**System Updates:**
11. Update `master-plan/master-plan.md` media tab with new items
12. Update `Research/.processing_log.json` with media curation timestamp
13. Note in processing log: count of new items added, sources used, any conflicts flagged

---

## 12. EXAMPLE DECISION TREE

**Scenario:** Found Jake Wujastyk tweet about $BMNR

```
Q1: Is Jake in provider list?
    ‚Üí YES (Tier 1 analyst, appears in X Macro summaries)

Q2: Does tweet have specific thesis?
    ‚Üí YES (Williams % Range breakout + symmetrical triangle apex)

Q3: Can I extract permalink?
    ‚Üí YES (https://x.com/Jake__Wujastyk/status/1973873016007520522)

Q4: Is there entry/target/stop?
    ‚Üí PARTIAL (mentions $60 open as trigger, "potential 10%+ day" target)

Q5: Is this <7 days old?
    ‚Üí YES (Oct 3, 2025)

Q6: Does this conflict with system signals?
    ‚Üí NO (X Macro 72/100 BULLISH, composite 68/100 MODERATE BUY)

Q7: Is this duplicate of existing item?
    ‚Üí NO (Oct 2 item was different setup - volume gap vs triangle breakout)

DECISION: ‚úÖ ADD as Research Highlight, MEDIUM conviction

Blurb: "Williams % Range breakout + symmetrical triangle apex + volume shelf = potential 10%+ day. Last two Williams breakouts preceded significant moves. Watch open >$60 as confirmation trigger."

Tags: ["technical", "smallcap", "breakout", "setup"]
Link: https://x.com/Jake__Wujastyk/status/1973873016007520522
```

---

## 13. AUDIT TRAIL

Every decision should be auditable:

**"Why did you add this item?"**
‚Üí Met inclusion criteria [X], conviction level [Y], source priority [Z]

**"Why didn't you add that item?"**
‚Üí Failed criterion [red flag type] (e.g., no specific thesis / no link / duplicate / >7 days old)

**"Why is this HIGH conviction?"**
‚Üí Event probability [%] + precedent [historical pattern] + dateable catalyst [date] + analyst track record

**"Why did you archive that item?"**
‚Üí >7 days old + no new mentions in latest summaries OR trade already closed OR catalyst passed

---

## 14. QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing media tab updates, verify:

- [ ] All items have specific source links (no generic homepages)
- [ ] All blurbs follow 3-sentence formula (setup + insight + action)
- [ ] Conviction levels justified by criteria (not subjective preference)
- [ ] Tags are accurate and follow keyword logic
- [ ] No duplicates across categories
- [ ] Dates are current (<7 days for most items)
- [ ] Conflicts with signal system are flagged and explained
- [ ] Quantity guidelines respected (15-25 total items)
- [ ] Processing log updated with timestamp and item count

---

## 15. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

**Track Performance:**
- When item leads to profitable trade ‚Üí note in journal
- When item was false signal ‚Üí analyze why (improve inclusion criteria)
- When item was too late ‚Üí adjust timing thresholds
- When source becomes unreliable ‚Üí adjust priority ranking

**Monthly Review:**
- Which categories provided most alpha?
- Which analysts had highest hit rate?
- Which velocity thresholds were most predictive?
- Update criteria based on backtested performance
