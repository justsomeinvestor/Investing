## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Morning Session (9:30 AM)

**1. Tell Claude:**
```
"Generate trading signals from research dashboard"
```

**2. Claude will:**
- Load `master-plan/research-dashboard.html`
- Extract sentiment, consensus, trading levels, catalysts
- Identify your 3-5 best setups
- Score each setup (0-100 quality)
- Create market thesis
- Populate Command Center with signal cards

**3. You get:**
- Signal cards showing quality scores (40% Technical, 20% Consensus, 15% Sentiment, 15% Catalyst, 10% Volume)
- Clear entry/stop/target zones
- Risk/reward ratios for each
- Trading thesis for the day

### Throughout Day

**Mid-day check:**
```
"Check research, any new signals?"
```

**End of day review:**
```
"EOD signal review - what worked"
```

## 🎯 Core Concept: Signal Quality Score

Each signal gets scored on 5 dimensions (all from research dashboard):

```
COMPOSITE SCORE =
  (Technical Confirmation × 0.40) +           ← Chart pattern strength
  (Provider Consensus × 0.20) +               ← % of providers bullish
  (Sentiment Alignment × 0.15) +              ← AI interpretation match
  (Catalyst Timing × 0.15) +                  ← Economic event window
  (Volume/Flow Quality × 0.10)                ← Options/volume confirmation
```

**Example:**
```
Setup: ES Long at 5650
─────────────────────
Technical:      85  (double bottom, clean support)
Consensus:      73  (73% of providers bullish)
Sentiment:      75  (AI interpretation bullish)
Catalyst:       70  (CPI post-market, not disrupting)
Volume:         80  (call buying, positive flow)
─────────────────────
COMPOSITE:      76  → STRONG BUY tier
```

## 📊 Signal Quality Tiers

| Composite Score | Tier | Trading Action |
|-----------------|------|----------------|
| 90-100 | 🟢 EXTREME | Trade with full conviction |
| 75-89 | 🟢 STRONG | Trade with standard sizing |
| 60-74 | 🟡 MODERATE | Trade with reduced size, tight stops |
| 45-59 | 🔴 WEAK | Avoid unless strong edge |
| <45 | 🔴 AVOID | Don't trade |

## ✅ Success Criteria

This workflow is working if:

- [ ] You can generate signals in <2 minutes
- [ ] Each signal has clear entry/stop/target
- [ ] Quality score 75+ signals have ≥70% win rate
- [ ] Quality score 60-74 signals have ≥60% win rate
- [ ] You actively use signals to make trading decisions
- [ ] End-of-day review shows signal correlation to results

## 🚨 Important Notes

**Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to trade 1 signal with 80 score than 5 signals with 60 score
- Don't force weak signals just because you're bored

**Update Aggressively**
- If research dashboard changes significantly → rebuild
- If thesis breaks → don't keep trading old setups
- Keep signal cards in sync with current market

**Track Your Performance**
- Log which setups you executed
- Note win rate by signal quality tier
- Adjust component weightings based on YOUR results

**Use Context**
- Read the full thesis, not just the score
- Understand WHY a signal is strong
- Factor in your journal's historical patterns

---

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Day 1-2:** Use SIGNALS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   - Get familiar with signal tiers
   - Start running daily signal generation
   - Pick 1-2 signals to trade

2. **Day 3-5:** Study RESEARCH_DASHBOARD_TO_SIGNALS_WORKFLOW.md
   - Understand the 5-component scoring system
   - Learn how each component is calculated
   - See example session walkthrough

3. **Day 6+:** Advanced customization
   - Adjust component weightings for your style
   - Create custom signal card styling
   - Use extract_signals.py for automation

## 💬 Quick Questions

**Q: Do I need to run the Python script?**
A: No, Claude can manually extract and score. Script is optional automation.

**Q: Can I adjust the weights (40% technical, 20% consensus)?**
A: Yes! Adjust based on what works for YOUR trading. Intraday might be 50% technical, swing might be 30% sentiment.

**Q: What if research dashboard hasn't updated?**
A: Generate signals anyway - it'll use whatever's there. Or ask Claude to "refresh research dashboard data."

**Q: How do I know if a signal is stale?**
A: Check extraction time. If >3 hours old, request fresh signal generation.

**Q: Can I trade multiple setups at once?**
A: Yes! But only trade ones with quality score ≥60. Don't oversize weak signals.
