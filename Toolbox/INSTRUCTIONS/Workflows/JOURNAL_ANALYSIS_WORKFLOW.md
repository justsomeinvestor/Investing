## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS

### During Trading Day (Live Session)

1. **You trade and talk to Claude throughout the day**
   - "Just entered NVDA long at 189.50"
   - "SPY rejected at 665 resistance"
   - "That was a bad trade - entered without trigger stack"
   - "Good discipline today - waited for confirmation"

2. **Claude takes notes in real-time**
   - Appends to: `Journal/LIVE_SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Tracks: Trades, market observations, psychology, lessons
   - Structures data for analysis

3. **End of day or on-demand**
   - You: "analyze my journal"
   - Claude runs analysis workflow
   - Displays results in Command Center

- **Setup:** Resistance rejection (attempted 665.50 three times)

## 💭 Psychology Notes

- Morning: Focused and patient
- Mid-day: Good discipline, avoided FOMO
- Late day: Getting tired, passed on low-conviction setup (good call)

---

## ⚠️ Lessons Today

- ✅ Waited for confirmation before entry (improvement vs earlier this week)
- ⚠️ Sized too big on second trade (need to reduce)
- 💡 SPY rejection setups have been 7/10 this month - good edge

---

## 🎯 Observations

- Market was choppy 9:30-12:00, then ranged 12:00-16:00
- VIX stayed 18-20 (relatively calm)
- Breadth weak (10/25) - limited short opportunities
- BTC weakness was a headwind for equities mid-session

```

Claude updates this in real-time as you trade throughout the day.

## 🔍 WHAT GETS ANALYZED

### Trade Data
- Ticker, direction, entry/exit, P&L
- Time of day
- Setup type (support bounce, resistance short, breakout, etc.)
- Win/loss categorization

### Performance Metrics
- **Overall**: Total trades, win rate, total P&L
- **By Setup**: Which setups have best win rate?
- **By Hour**: Which time of day do you trade best?
- **By Condition**: How do you perform in STRONG vs WEAK vs MODERATE signals?

### Pattern Recognition
- **Recurring Mistakes**: What errors repeat? (e.g., "no trigger stack" = 6x this month)
- **Rules Violations**: When do you break your own rules?
- **Discipline Patterns**: Discipline days vs overtrading days
- **Emotional Correlation**: Does your win rate correlate with psychology state?

### AI Coaching
- **Daily Feedback**: Today's performance vs baseline
- **Weekly Summary**: Week's trends and insights
- **Predictive Insights**: "You tend to overtrade when VIX >25"
- **Historical Comparison**: "Last time this setup appeared, you were 7/10"
