X (Twitter) Social Sentiment Analysis Workflow
=============================================

Purpose
-------
Extract actionable intelligence from X/Twitter posts to:
1. Gauge crowd sentiment (contrarian indicator)
2. Identify emerging narratives before mainstream
3. Track influencer conviction and positioning
4. Spot early project catalysts
5. Validate technical levels (crowdsourced support/resistance)

Data Source
-----------
**NEW STRUCTURE (Oct 2025):**
- Research/X/Crypto/x_list_posts_*_archived.json - TODAY'S Crypto tweets (READ THIS!)
- Research/X/Macro/x_list_posts_*_archived.json - TODAY'S Macro tweets (READ THIS!)
- Research/X/Technicals/x_list_posts_*_archived.json - TODAY'S Technical tweets (READ THIS!)

**IMPORTANT:** Always read the `_archived.json` files for the current date.
These contain ONLY today's tweets (small, manageable files).
DO NOT read the accumulating source files - they contain weeks of old data!

Format: JSON array of tweet objects with text, author, timestamp, engagement metrics

**Archival Process:**
Run `python scripts/archive_x_daily.py YYYY-MM-DD` BEFORE analysis to:
1. Extract today's tweets from accumulating source files
2. Create today's archived files (small, focused)
3. Move historical data to separate archive
4. Clear source files for tomorrow's scraping

**Output Files:**
- Research/X/Crypto/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Crypto_Summary.md
- Research/X/Macro/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Macro_Summary.md
- Research/X/Technicals/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Technicals_Summary.md

Analysis Workflow
-----------------

STEP 1: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
---------------------------
Goal: Calculate overall bullish/bearish sentiment score (0-100)

1. Read x_posts.json and extract all tweet texts
2. Count sentiment indicators:

   BULLISH KEYWORDS/PHRASES:
   - Keywords: bullish, moon, pump, long, buy, accumulate, breakout, ATH, rally, bounce, support holding
   - Emojis: 🚀, 💎, 🔥, 📈, 💰, 🌙, ⬆️, 💪, ✅
   - Phrases: "to the moon", "going up", "buy the dip", "bottom is in", "new ATH"

   BEARISH KEYWORDS/PHRASES:
   - Keywords: bearish, dump, crash, short, sell, panic, breakdown, capitulation, resistance rejected
   - Emojis: 💀, 📉, ⬇️, ⚠️, 🩸, 😱, ❌
   - Phrases: "going down", "sell the rip", "top is in", "death cross", "bear market"

   NEUTRAL:
   - No strong directional keywords

3. Weight by author influence:

   TIER 1 (10x weight):
   - LynAldenContact, MarkYusko, RaoulGMI, saylor, APompliano, novogratz
   - cburniske, AriDavidPaul, BalajisS

   TIER 2 (5x weight):
   - scottmelker, coinbureau, CryptoCobain, PeterLBrandt, CryptoWizardd
   - trader1sz, MoonOverlord, aixbt_agent

   TIER 3 (1x weight):
   - All other accounts

4. Calculate sentiment score:

   Weighted_Bullish = Sum of (bullish_tweets × author_weight)
   Weighted_Bearish = Sum of (bearish_tweets × author_weight)
   Total_Weighted = Weighted_Bullish + Weighted_Bearish

   Sentiment_Score = (Weighted_Bullish / Total_Weighted) × 100

   Result: 0-100 score (0 = extreme bearish, 50 = neutral, 100 = extreme bullish)

5. Classify sentiment tier:

   0-24: EXTREME FEAR (capitulation, max contrarian buy signal)
   25-44: BEARISH (fear building, contrarian setup forming)
   45-64: MIXED (healthy debate, no clear edge)
   65-79: BULLISH (normal bull market sentiment)
   80-100: EXTREME EUPHORIA (approaching top, contrarian sell signal)

6. Calculate signal impact for Breadth module:

   IF Sentiment_Score 80-100 (EXTREME EUPHORIA):
     Breadth penalty = -5 points (fade the euphoria)

   ELSE IF Sentiment_Score 70-79 (STRONG BULLISH):
     Breadth adjustment = -2 points (caution, getting frothy)

   ELSE IF Sentiment_Score 45-69 (MIXED to MODERATE BULLISH):
     Breadth adjustment = 0 to +2 points (neutral to healthy)

   ELSE IF Sentiment_Score 25-44 (BEARISH):
     Breadth bonus = +4 points (contrarian setup)

   ELSE IF Sentiment_Score 0-24 (EXTREME FEAR):
     Breadth bonus = +5 points (max contrarian buy signal)


STEP 2: TICKER TRACKING & VELOCITY ANALYSIS (NEW - Oct 2025)
------------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Track trending tickers and calculate mention velocity for trading edge

**CRYPTO TICKERS (from Research/X/Crypto/):**
1. Extract all crypto ticker mentions ($BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $ZEC, etc.)
2. Count absolute mentions over last 24 hours
3. Compare to baseline (7-day average) to calculate velocity %
4. Flag categories:
   - BREAKOUT NARRATIVE: >500% velocity increase
   - ACCELERATING: +100% to +500% velocity
   - EMERGING: New tickers with 15+ mentions (previously <5)
   - COOLING/EXHAUSTION: Negative velocity after spike

**Crypto Example Output:**
- BTC: 144 mentions (+15% velocity) - "Leadership intact, consolidation above key EMAs"
- ZEC: 61 mentions (-60% velocity) - "Privacy narrative cooling from spike - EXHAUSTION PATTERN, take profits"
- ETH: 41 mentions (+25% velocity) - "HTF close >$4.6K flagged as confirmation level"
- SOL: 28 mentions (+90% velocity) - "Relative strength, ecosystem flows"
- XPL: 22 mentions (NEW) - "Emerging discussion - watch for follow-through"

**MACRO TICKERS (from Research/X/Macro/):**
1. Extract all equity/index ticker mentions (SPX, SPY, QQQ, TSLA, NVDA, etc.)
2. Count absolute mentions over last 24 hours
3. Compare to baseline (7-day average) to calculate velocity %
4. Flag categories:
   - EVENT-DRIVEN SPIKE: >200% velocity (usually macro events like NFP, FOMC)
   - LEADERSHIP WATCH: >150% velocity on individual stocks
   - EMERGING SETUP: Small-cap tickers with 2-5 mentions from known analysts

**Macro Example Output:**
- SPX: 30 mentions (+220% velocity) - "6,612-6,720 range coiling - breakout/breakdown imminent"
- TSLA: 29 mentions (+180% velocity) - "Relative strength, Oct 10 $460 calls +62%"
- NVDA: 28 mentions (+160% velocity) - "AI leadership intact - earnings path critical"
- $JD: 3 mentions (NEW) - "Volume gap thesis active per Jake Wujastyk"

**VELOCITY CALCULATION:**
```
Baseline = 7-day average mentions for ticker
Current = Last 24h mentions
Velocity = ((Current - Baseline) / Baseline) × 100%

If Velocity > +500%: BREAKOUT NARRATIVE (high conviction)
If Velocity > +100%: ACCELERATING (momentum building)
If Velocity 0% to +100%: STEADY (normal trend)
If Velocity < 0%: COOLING (watch for exhaustion/reversal)
If Velocity < -50% after spike: EXHAUSTION PATTERN (contrarian sell signal)
```

**TRADING EDGE FROM VELOCITY:**
- Velocity reversals = early warning signals (ZEC -60% = take profits)
- Event-driven spikes = volatility windows (NFP +250% = reduce sizes)
- Emerging tickers = alpha opportunities ($JD, $BMNR, $XPL)
- Leadership shifts = market canaries (TSLA/NVDA relative strength)


STEP 3: NARRATIVE TRACKING
---------------------------
Goal: Identify hot narratives and trending topics

1. Extract theme keywords from high-velocity tickers:
   - "privacy", "AI", "gaming", "DeFi", "staking", "ETF", "altcoin season"
   - Count frequency and flag trending themes

6. List top 5 narratives by mention velocity


STEP 3: INFLUENCER CONSENSUS
-----------------------------
Goal: Track what respected analysts are positioning for

1. Filter tweets by TIER 1 influencers only
2. Manually review their recent tweets (last 24 hours)
3. Categorize their stance:
   - BULLISH: Clear long bias, positive outlook
   - CAUTIOUS/MIXED: Balanced view, waiting for signals
   - BEARISH: Defensive positioning, warning signs
   - NEUTRAL: No clear directional view

4. Document specific takes:
   - Quote key tweets
   - Note position changes (if they flipped from bearish → bullish, that's a signal)

Example output:
BULLISH:
- Mark Yusko: "Bitcoin in bull market for 15 years"
- Chris Burniske: High ZEC conviction (3 tweets on privacy narrative)

CAUTIOUS:
- Lyn Alden: (check for recent tweets)

BEARISH:
- (none detected)


STEP 4: TECHNICAL LEVELS EXTRACTION
------------------------------------
Goal: Crowdsource support/resistance levels from traders

1. Search tweets for price level patterns:
   - $XX,XXX format (e.g., "$108,000")
   - XXK format (e.g., "108K")
   - Percentage references (e.g., "2% below 50-DMA")

2. Extract technical terms in same tweet:
   - "support", "resistance", "entry", "stop", "target"
   - "breakout", "breakdown", "accumulation", "distribution"

3. Count how many traders mention the same level
   - If 3+ traders cite "$108K support" → add to key levels

4. Cross-reference with existing TradingView data
   - Validate crowdsourced levels against technical provider data
   - Flag consensus levels (both X + TradingView cite same level)


STEP 5: PROJECT ALPHA / CATALYSTS
----------------------------------
Goal: Spot early project developments before mainstream

1. Search tweets for announcement keywords:
   - "BREAKING", "LIVE", "LAUNCH", "ANNOUNCES", "INTEGRATION"
   - "partnership", "acquisition", "funding", "staking", "TGE"

2. Extract ticker + event + date (if mentioned)

Example:
- $EIGEN: "EigenAI launch (AI profits flow to token)" - Oct 1
- $BERT: "Staking LIVE (5-12% APR)" - Oct 1
- Espresso: "ApeChain community call Oct 2, Q4 TGE"

3. Add to "Emerging Catalysts" section


STEP 6: HYPE CYCLE INDICATOR
-----------------------------
Goal: Measure euphoria/panic levels

1. Calculate hype metrics:
   - Emoji density = (emoji count / total characters) × 100
   - Caps lock % = (CAPS characters / total characters) × 100
   - Exclamation marks per tweet = (! count / tweet count)

2. Score hype level (1-5):
   1 = DEPRESSION (no emojis, minimal excitement)
   2 = CAUTIOUS (low emoji/caps usage)
   3 = NEUTRAL (moderate activity)
   4 = EUPHORIC (high emoji/caps usage)
   5 = MANIA (excessive !!!, 🚀🚀🚀, ALL CAPS)

3. Interpretation:
   - Hype 4-5 = Contrarian sell signal (too much euphoria)
   - Hype 1-2 = Contrarian buy signal (capitulation)
   - Hype 3 = Neutral


STEP 6.5: TREND TRACKING & WORD FREQUENCY ANALYSIS (NEW)
--------------------------------------------------------
Goal: Track trending words/tickers/themes over time to measure narrative momentum and identify early signals

**CRITICAL: This data MUST be updated every workflow run to maintain historical continuity**

A. Extract Top Trending Words by Category:

   Read through BOTH x_list_posts JSON files (Crypto + Macro) and count mentions:

   1. **CRYPTO TICKERS** ($BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $ZEC, $XRP, $ADA, etc.)
      - Count every mention of crypto ticker symbols
      - Include variations: BTC, $BTC, #BTC
      - Track top 20 by mention count

   2. **EQUITY TICKERS** (SPX, SPY, QQQ, $TSLA, $NVDA, $AAPL, etc.)
      - Count equity/index ticker mentions
      - Include variations: TSLA, $TSLA, #TSLA
      - Track top 15 by mention count

   3. **TECH/SECTOR THEMES** (AI, privacy, DeFi, staking, gaming, L2, ZK, etc.)
      - Count technology/sector keyword mentions
      - Focus on: AI, privacy, DeFi, NFT, gaming, metaverse, L2, rollup, zkSync, staking, LSD, restaking, RWA, MEV
      - Track top 15 themes

   4. **MACRO THEMES** (Fed, FOMC, rates, inflation, NFP, CPI, recession, etc.)
      - Count macro/economic keyword mentions
      - Focus on: Fed, FOMC, rates, inflation, CPI, PPI, NFP, employment, recession, GDP, yields, bonds, VIX
      - Track top 15 themes

   5. **SENTIMENT WORDS** (bullish, bearish, breakout, dump, pump, etc.)
      - Count sentiment indicator words
      - Focus on: bullish, bearish, moon, dump, pump, crash, rally, breakout, breakdown, FOMO, capitulation
      - Track top 10 sentiment words

   6. **NARRATIVE PHRASES** (multi-word trends)
      - Count common phrases: "altcoin season", "rate cut", "all time high", "bear market", "bull market"
      - Track top 10 phrases

B. Calculate Velocity (Change vs Previous Day):

   Load yesterday's trending words file: Research/X/Trends/YYYY-MM-DD_trending_words.json

   For each word/ticker:
   ```
   Velocity_24h = ((Today_Count - Yesterday_Count) / Yesterday_Count) × 100%

   If velocity >+200%: 🔥 HOT (narrative accelerating)
   If velocity +50% to +200%: ↗️ RISING (gaining momentum)
   If velocity -50% to +50%: → STABLE (normal)
   If velocity <-50%: ⚠️ COOLING (exhaustion signal)
   ```

C. Create Today's Trending Words File:

   Create: Research/X/Trends/YYYY-MM-DD_trending_words.json

   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-10-03T00:45:00Z",
     "source": "X Crypto + X Macro combined",
     "total_posts_analyzed": 9240,
     "categories": {
       "tickers_crypto": [
         {"word": "$BTC", "mentions": 144, "rank": 1, "velocity_24h": "+15%", "signal": "↗️ RISING"},
         {"word": "$ZEC", "mentions": 61, "rank": 4, "velocity_24h": "-60%", "signal": "⚠️ COOLING"}
       ],
       "tickers_equities": [
         {"word": "SPX", "mentions": 30, "rank": 1, "velocity_24h": "+220%", "signal": "🔥 HOT"}
       ],
       "tech_themes": [
         {"word": "AI", "mentions": 67, "rank": 1, "velocity_24h": "+45%", "signal": "↗️ RISING"},
         {"word": "privacy", "mentions": 52, "rank": 2, "velocity_24h": "-40%", "signal": "⚠️ COOLING"}
       ],
       "macro_themes": [
         {"word": "Fed", "mentions": 89, "rank": 1, "velocity_24h": "+400%", "signal": "🔥 HOT"}
       ],
       "sentiment_words": [
         {"word": "bullish", "mentions": 134, "rank": 1, "velocity_24h": "+18%", "signal": "→ STABLE"}
       ],
       "narrative_phrases": [
         {"phrase": "altcoin season", "mentions": 34, "rank": 1, "velocity_24h": "+320%", "signal": "🔥 HOT"}
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

D. Update Historical Database:

   Update: Research/X/Trends/trends_database.json

   Add today's snapshot to history array (keep 90 days max):
   ```json
   {
     "last_updated": "2025-10-03T00:45:00Z",
     "retention_days": 90,
     "history": [
       {
         "date": "2025-10-03",
         "top_tickers_crypto": ["$BTC", "$ETH", "$SOL", "$ZEC"],
         "top_tickers_equities": ["SPX", "$TSLA", "$NVDA"],
         "top_tech_themes": ["AI", "privacy", "staking"],
         "top_macro_themes": ["Fed", "rates", "employment"],
         "snapshot_file": "Research/X/Trends/2025-10-03_trending_words.json"
       }
     ],
     "7_day_movers": {
       "gaining": [
         {"word": "$SOL", "change_7d": "+156%", "category": "tickers_crypto"},
         {"word": "Fed", "change_7d": "+210%", "category": "macro_themes"}
       ],
       "losing": [
         {"word": "$ZEC", "change_7d": "-45%", "category": "tickers_crypto"}
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

E. Identify Trading Signals from Trends:

   **HOT SIGNALS (🔥 Velocity >+200%)**:
   - Narrative acceleration = event risk or emerging catalyst
   - Example: "Fed" +400% = macro event imminent (NFP Friday)
   - Example: "$ZEC" +1200% = parabolic hype (watch for reversal)
   - Action: Add to Media & Catalysts tab as "Data Anomaly" or "Upcoming Catalyst"

   **COOLING SIGNALS (⚠️ Velocity <-50%)**:
   - Exhaustion pattern = take profits
   - Example: "$ZEC" -60% after +1200% = narrative exhaustion
   - Action: Add to Media & Catalysts tab as "Exhaustion Signal"

   **EMERGING SIGNALS (New words appearing)**:
   - 0 mentions → 10+ mentions = early alpha opportunity
   - Example: "$XPL" appears with 22 mentions (was 0)
   - Action: Add to Media & Catalysts tab as "Research Highlight - Emerging"

F. **CRITICAL: Update master-plan.md with Trending Words**:
   - Navigate to master-plan/master-plan.md
   - Find the "xsentiment" tab object (around line 180-300)
   - Locate the "trending_words" section (after "influencer_consensus")
   - Replace the entire "trending_words" object with today's data from your analysis in steps A-E above
   - Keep the same JSON structure: tickers_crypto, tickers_equity, tech_themes, macro_themes, sentiment_words, narrative_phrases
   - Each item must have: {"word": "...", "mentions": X, "velocity_24h": "±X%", "signal": "emoji LABEL"}
   - This ensures the dashboard displays live trending data on every refresh


STEP 7: GENERATE SUMMARIES (UPDATED - Oct 2025)

**C. Update master-plan.md Technicals Tab for X/Technicals Summary:**

1. Add new provider card "🐦 X Social Technical Analysis" with:
   - Total posts analyzed count
   - Top chart patterns consensus (e.g., "BTC Cup & Handle (3 analysts), SPX Bull Flag (2 analysts)")
   - Key levels crowdsourced (e.g., "BTC $118K support (5 mentions), SPX 6,720 resistance (7 mentions)")
   - Indicator signals (e.g., "RSI bullish divergence H4 (CryptoCred, PeterLBrandt)")
   - Time frame alignment status (e.g., "HTF bullish, LTF consolidating = continuation setup")

   - Cross-reference X/Technicals levels with TradingView BTC/SPX summaries
   - Highlight divergences between social consensus and chart analysis
   - Use X/Technicals for confirmation of TradingView setups


**D. Breadth Signals Calculation (Step 3.5 of master workflow):**

Use CRYPTO sentiment score for Breadth module (not macro):
- If Crypto Sentiment 0-24 (EXTREME FEAR): +5 points (max contrarian buy)
- If Crypto Sentiment 25-44 (BEARISH): +4 points (contrarian setup)
- If Crypto Sentiment 45-79 (MIXED to BULLISH): 0 to +2 points (neutral)
- If Crypto Sentiment 80-89 (STRONG BULLISH): -2 points (caution, frothy)
- If Crypto Sentiment 90-100 (EXTREME EUPHORIA): -5 points (fade euphoria)

Rationale: Crypto sentiment more relevant for risk-on/risk-off breadth than macro equity sentiment


**D. Dashboard Rendering (research-dashboard.html automatically renders):**

The renderXSentiment() function will automatically display:
- Crypto vs Macro sentiment cards (side-by-side)
- Crypto trending tickers with velocity colors
- Crypto key levels table
- Macro trending tickers with velocity colors
- Macro emerging tickers (highlighted in gold)
- Macro key levels table
- Macro event risk warnings

No manual HTML updates needed - just update master-plan.md JSON structure

**Technicals Tab:**
- Extract crowd-sourced levels from "Technical Levels Mentioned by Traders" section
- Extract BTC Trader's Realized Price from Top Narratives
- Extract influencer-specific levels (Trader Mayne sweep zones) from Influencer Consensus
- Extract hype cycle position from Sentiment Breakdown (% extreme bullish)
- Extract emoji/caps/exclamation indicators from narrative analysis
- Add to "🐦 X Crowd-Sourced Levels" and "🐦 X Hype Cycle as Vol Predictor" provider cards
- Update aiInterpretation to reference crowd levels and hype cycle patterns

**Daily Planner Priorities:**
- HIGH: "WATCH X for institutional announcements" (if pattern established)
- MEDIUM: "ETH: Watch for HTF close above $X.XK" (use level from Technical Levels section)
- MEDIUM: "Monitor Fed narrative velocity (currently +X%)" (use velocity from Top Narratives)
- MEDIUM: Exit watches for exhaustion narratives (declining velocity tickers)
- LOW: Track TOTAL3, track debates (ETH vs SOL)

**Key Levels:**
- Add crowd-sourced levels from X to keyLevels array alongside TradingView levels
- Mark with source attribution (e.g., "CT consensus" or "Trader Mayne H4 sweep")


Data Refresh Frequency
-----------------------
- Run analysis when x_posts.json is updated (ideally daily)
- More frequent during high volatility periods
- Compare sentiment changes over time (inflections = signals)


Notes
-----
- X sentiment is a CONTRARIAN indicator at extremes (fade euphoria, buy fear)
- X sentiment is a CONFIRMATION indicator at moderate levels (validates other signals)
- Influencer consensus > random CT consensus
- Narrative velocity matters more than absolute mention count (rate of change)
- Cross-reference X data with other providers (don't trade X data alone)
