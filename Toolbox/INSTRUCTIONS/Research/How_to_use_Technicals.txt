[Main metric value and classification]

## Key Levels/Signals
- Support: [levels]
- Resistance: [levels]
- Indicators: [RSI, MACD, etc.]

## Trend Analysis
[Short-term, medium-term outlook]

## Actionable Insights
[What this means for positioning]

## Risk Flags
[Any warning signals or divergences]
```

Notes
-----
- Update technical summaries daily or whenever significant market moves occur
- Technical data is most valuable when combined with fundamental analysis (YouTube) and news (RSS)
- Look for confluence: when multiple technical sources agree on key levels, weight them heavily
- Divergences between price action and indicators often signal reversals
- Always note the timestamp - technical data becomes stale quickly

Intraday Refresh Protocol (BTC/SPX)
-----------------------------------
Use this when price action makes prior levels stale.

1) Detect staleness
   - If BTC or SPX moves >1% intraday from prior support/flip/resistance OR cleanly flips resistance → support (e.g., BTC $118K)
   - If latest TradingView summary (BTC/SPX) is not dated today and price structure shifted

2) Refresh provider summaries
   - Create today’s file under TradingView BTC/TradingView SPX
   - Include 24h high/low and updated support (retest zone), flip level, and resistance band
   - Note changes vs prior day (e.g., “111–112K sweep zone is stale; structure shifted to 116–120K”)

3) Propagate to downstream files (manual edits)
   - master-plan/master-plan.md (front matter JSON):
     * dashboard.metrics: update "BTC Support" (and SPX/ETH if applicable)
     * dashboard.dailyPlanner.keyLevels: set entry/stop/target to today’s levels
     * dashboard.dailyPlanner.signalData.assets.<ASSET>: update entry/stop/target; tweak module breakdown if regime/vol changed
   - Research/YYYY-MM-DD_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md: update "BTC support:" line
   - Research/X/Crypto/YYYY-MM-DD_X_Crypto_Summary.md: update crowdsourced levels to match new ranges
   - Research/.processing_log.json: bump Technicals timestamps for TradingView BTC/SPX and summary_file paths

4) Re-run Signals (see Trading/signal-system/How to use_Signals.txt)
   - If levels or vol changed materially, recompute module scores and refresh the composite/tier and per-asset entries in master-plan.md
