# How to use — RSS (AI-Only, No-Archive) — v1.3 (2025-10-06)

**Purpose:** When you (the AI) enter this folder, read what’s here and produce concise overviews.  
**Do NOT** move, back up, or archive any files as part of this process.

---

## What to do (per Provider)
1) Open `<Provider>/Feed Data/` and read all article `.md` files in that folder (and subfolders if present).
2) Think across the set: extract **Key Themes**, **Market/Macro Notes**, **Risks**, **Tickers/Names**, and **Instruments** (ETFs or single names).
3) Write/refresh exactly **one** overview file **in the provider folder** using this filename:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD_<Provider>_RSS_Overview.md`

### Provider Overview — Required Structure
```
# <Provider> — RSS Overview (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Key Themes
- <theme 1>
- <theme 2>
- <theme 3>

## Market / Macro Notes
- <bullets linking themes to FX/rates/earnings/sector rotation/geopolitics>

## Risks & Watchouts
- <policy, data quality, headline reversals, liquidity, etc.>

## Instruments (for the playbook)
- ETFs: <comma-separated list>
- Single names: <comma-separated list>

## Metrics (for @master-plan.md)
- sentiment: <0–100>
- narratives: [ "theme1", "theme2", ... ]
- regions: [ "US","EU","EM","APAC" ]
- tickers: [ "SPY","QQQ","AAPL","NVDA","BTC","ETH", ... ]
```
*Keep bullets short and practical. Focus on why it matters and how it could be traded.*

## If there are multiple Providers
After creating all provider overviews for today:
1) Read every `*_RSS_Overview.md` created **today**.
2) Create a single roll-up in `Research/RSS/`:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD_RSS_AllProviders_Overview.md`

### All Providers Overview — Required Structure
```
# RSS — All Providers Overview (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Consensus Themes
- <merged themes across providers with short justification>

## Most Mentioned Tickers
- <comma-separated list>

## Provider Highlights
- <Provider A>: top 2–3 themes; notable tickers
- <Provider B>: top 2–3 themes; notable tickers

## Metrics (for @master-plan.md)
- narratives: [ "theme1", "theme2", ... ]
- tickers: [ "SPY","QQQ","AAPL","NVDA", ... ]
- sentiment: <overall 0–100>
- regions: [ "US","EU","EM","APAC" ]
```

## Guardrails
- One overview per provider per day; **refresh in place** if you add insights.
- Stay concise and neutral; do not paste large quotes.
- **No archiving, backups, or file moves** are part of this instruction.

---

## Date Filter — *Only process today's files*
- **Primary rule:** Only read article `.md` files whose **filename starts with today’s date** (`YYYY-MM-DD_`) **or** whose **LastModified date is today**.
- **If no files match today:** read the **newest date available** (the most recent `YYYY-MM-DD_` prefix across files), and write the overview using **that date** in the filename.
- The **All Providers Overview** must **only** include provider overviews dated **today** (or the chosen newest date if today has no files).

---

## Provider folders — uniform handling
- Treat **every immediate subfolder** under `Research/RSS/` as a **Provider** (e.g., `CNBC`, `CoinDesk`, `Federal Reserve`, `Investing.com`, `MarketWatch`, `Robot Wealth`, `Seeking Alpha`, `Trading With Rayner`).  
- For **each** provider:
  - Expect a `Feed Data/` subfolder. If it exists, **process it**; if it doesn't, **skip** that provider silently.
  - Read only **today’s** `.md` files in `Feed Data/` (see *Date Filter* above). If none, use the **newest date available**.
  - Write/refresh `YYYY-MM-DD_<Provider>_RSS_Overview.md` in the **provider folder root**.
  - Use the **provider folder name as-is** in the filename, including spaces or punctuation (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD_Federal Reserve_RSS_Overview.md`).
- The **All Providers Overview** should include **all providers** that produced an overview for today (or the chosen newest date).
