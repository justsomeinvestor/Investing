**Economic Calendar Processing Guide**

Purpose
-------
Extract and integrate high-impact economic events from calendar-event-list.csv into the macro analysis workflow.

Data Source
-----------
File: Research/Macro/calendar-event-list.csv
Columns: Id, Start, Name, Impact, Currency

Filtering Rules
---------------
1. **Currency**: USD ONLY
2. **Impact**: HIGH and MEDIUM only (ignore LOW and NONE)
3. **Timezone**: Convert all times to EST and include timezone stamp

Processing Workflow
-------------------

When running the master plan workflow (How to use_MP.txt):

1. **Read CSV File**
   - Load Research/Macro/calendar-event-list.csv
   - Parse all events for current month

2. **Apply Filters**
   - Keep only: Currency = "USD"
   - Keep only: Impact = "HIGH" or Impact = "MEDIUM"
   - Discard all other events

3. **Timezone Conversion**
   - Convert Start time to EST
   - Format: "MMM DD, YYYY HH:MM EST"
   - Example: "Oct 01, 2025 12:15 EST"

4. **Group Events**
   - **Today**: Events occurring on current date
   - **This Week**: Events within next 7 days
   - **Next Week**: Events 8-14 days out
   - **Rest of Month**: Events beyond 14 days

5. **Create Macro Overview**
   - File: Research/Macro/YYYY-MM-DD_Economic_Calendar_Summary.md
   - Include:
     * Date range covered
     * Total HIGH impact events count
     * Total MEDIUM impact events count
     * Key events today and this week
     * Market-moving events to watch

6. **Extract for Dashboard Integration**
   - Today's events (HIGH/MEDIUM)
   - This week's critical events (HIGH only)
   - Format as JSON array for master-plan.md

Output Format for master-plan.md
----------------------------------

economicCalendar: {
  "today": [
    {
      "time": "12:15 EST",
      "event": "ADP Employment Change",
      "impact": "HIGH"
    },
    {
      "time": "14:00 EST",
      "event": "ISM Manufacturing PMI",
      "impact": "HIGH"
    }
  ],
  "thisWeek": [
    {
      "date": "Oct 04",
      "time": "08:30 EST",
      "event": "Nonfarm Payrolls",
      "impact": "HIGH"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "3 HIGH-impact events this week (employment, manufacturing, Fed speakers). Market volatility expected around NFP Friday."
}

Impact Level Definitions
------------------------
- **HIGH**: Market-moving events (NFP, CPI, FOMC, GDP)
  - Expect volatility, volume spikes, potential trend changes
  - Trade with caution around these events

- **MEDIUM**: Sector-specific or secondary indicators
  - Can move specific assets or confirm trends
  - Monitor but less systemic risk than HIGH events

Integration Notes
-----------------
- Economic calendar refreshed during master plan workflow (Step 3: Gather Provider Data)
- Data flows: CSV → Macro overview → master-plan.md → research-dashboard.html
- Calendar displays in Macro tab below provider insights
- Color coding: RED for HIGH impact, ORANGE for MEDIUM impact
- Events sorted chronologically within each time bucket

Example Processing
------------------

Input (from CSV):
01214b5c-2d19-4626-b1ba-73135512dfec,10/01/2025 12:15:00,ADP Employment Change,HIGH,USD

Output (for master-plan.md):
{
  "time": "12:15 EST",
  "event": "ADP Employment Change",
  "impact": "HIGH"
}

Refresh Frequency
-----------------
- Daily during market hours
- Before major trading sessions (pre-market routine)
- Whenever CSV file is updated with new month's data
