## 📊 Journal Entry Format

Every trade now captures **three layers of information:**

### Layer 1: Raw Capture
```
"A soul that we were coming up into not last week's high but
the previous week's high and it started to look like it was a
little bit weak like it might roll over..."
```
*Your exact words - how you think*

### Layer 2: Structured Data
```
Entry: $14.33 | Shares: 600 | Setup: Mean Reversion | Tier: MODERATE
Stop: $14.60 | T1: $14.00 | T2: $13.60 | R/R: 1:2.5
```
*Organized for analysis*

### Layer 3: Learning Metrics
```
Similar Setups This Month: 4 (75% win rate)
Your Best Window: Morning entries (82% win rate)
This Trade Quality: Everything working in your favor
Growth Area: Position sizing (46% account is elevated)
```
*Patterns that drive improvement*

---

## 🧠 Pattern Tracking System

Every journal entry now feeds into a learning engine that tracks:

### Performance Metrics
- **Win rate by setup type** (consolidation fades, breakouts, etc)
- **Win rate by time of day** (morning vs afternoon vs overnight)
- **Win rate by emotional state** (confident vs uncertain vs FOMO)
- **Win rate by decision quality** (planned vs reactive vs impulse)

### Personal Edges Identified
- Morning entries: 82% win rate ✅
- Mean reversion setups: 75% win rate ✅
- Event-aware trades: 78% win rate ✅
- Planned trades: higher probability than reactive

### Growth Opportunities
- Position sizing (46% account is elevated)
- Overnight leverage risk (3x inverse overnight = risky)
- Emotional discipline (track how confidence correlates to results)
