# Dashboard Unified Structure - All 5 Tabs Complete

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All dashboard tabs now use unified 6-field format
**Impact**: Consistent visual design, standardized AI narrative generation, scannability via 600-char limits

---

## Executive Summary

The investment dashboard now displays **all 5 AI-interpretation tabs** using a unified 6-field structure:

1. **Daily Planner** ✅ (Already had structure, verified)
2. **Markets Intelligence** ✅ (Created Oct 23)
3. **News & Catalysts** ✅ (Created Oct 23)
4. **Portfolio** ✅ (Unified Oct 23)
5. **X Sentiment** ✅ (Unified Oct 23)
6. **Technicals** ✅ (Unified Oct 23)

Each tab displays three visually distinct sections:
- **Summary Pulse**: Market context and situation overview (≤600 chars)
- **Key Insight**: The ONE critical insight that dominates today (≤600 chars)
- **Actionable Focus**: Specific guidance with triggers and levels (≤600 chars)

Plus metadata fields:
- **sentiment**: cautiously bullish | neutral | cautiously bearish | bullish | bearish
- **confidence**: low | medium | medium-high | high
- **updatedAt**: ISO timestamp showing when AI synthesis was last performed

## The Unified 6-Field Structure

```yaml
aiInterpretation:
  updatedAt: '2025-10-23T14:45:32Z'
  summary: 'Rich context narrative addressing current market regime...' # ≤600 chars
  keyInsight: 'The ONE critical insight dominating markets today...' # ≤600 chars
  action: 'Specific actionable guidance with triggers and levels...' # ≤600 chars
  sentiment: cautiously bullish  # or: neutral, cautiously bearish, bullish, bearish
  confidence: medium-high  # or: low, medium, medium-high, high
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Consistent across all tabs (no different formats to learn)
- ✅ 600-char limit = scannability (tweet-length narratives)
- ✅ Three sections = quick scanning without scrolling
- ✅ Sentiment + Confidence = instant mood/conviction assessment
- ✅ updatedAt = transparency on freshness of analysis

## How Updates Happen: The Wingman Dash Workflow

When you run: `python scripts/automation/wingman_dash.py 2025-10-23`

**Phase 1**: Timestamp verification - checks which tabs are stale
**Phase 2**: Sync scripts - gather current data from Research cache
**Phase 3**: Master-plan update - populate data-driven fields
**Phase 4**: Health check - verify all sections current
**Phase 5**: **CLAUDE AI SYNTHESIS** - YOU synthesize research files into narratives

```
Phase 5 tells Claude AI:
- Read these research files: Market_Sentiment_Overview.md, Technical_Analysis.md, etc.
- Synthesize 3 narrative fields (≤600 chars each)
- Provide sentiment + confidence assessment
- Update master-plan.md with fresh analysis
- Set updatedAt timestamp
```

**Result**: All 6 tabs receive fresh AI-synthesized narratives in one workflow run.

## Integration Points

### wingman_dash.py Phase 5
**File**: `scripts/automation/wingman_dash.py` (Lines 309-332)

All 5 tabs included in section_mappings:
```python
'tabs.dailyPlanner.aiInterpretation': ['Research/_cache/daily_planner_analysis.json', ...],
'tabs.portfolio.aiInterpretation': ['Research/Equity_Dashboard_State.md', ...],
'tabs.markets.aiInterpretation': ['Research/Market_Sentiment_Overview.md', ...],
'tabs.news_catalysts.aiInterpretation': ['Research/News_and_Catalysts.md', ...],
'tabs.xsentiment.aiInterpretation': ['Research/Sentiment_Analysis.md', ...],
'tabs.technicals.aiInterpretation': ['Research/Technical_Analysis_Summary.md', ...],
```

When Phase 5 runs, it generates prompts for each tab asking you to synthesize insights.

### AI_NARRATIVE_FORMATTING_GUIDE.md
**File**: `toolbox/AI_NARRATIVE_FORMATTING_GUIDE.md`

Provides standardized guidance for all 6 tabs:
- Character count requirements (600-char limit)
- Tone/style guidelines (Bloomberg professional, data-driven, specific)
- Structure patterns (Market Structure → Key Insight → Action)
- Common mistakes & fixes
- Tab-specific examples
- Quality checklist before submission

### master-plan.md YAML Structure
**File**: `master-plan/master-plan.md` (Lines 106-784)

All tabs follow pattern:
```yaml
- id: tab_name
  label: Icon Label
  aiInterpretation:
    updatedAt: '2025-10-23T...'
    summary: '...'
    keyInsight: '...'
    action: '...'
    sentiment: value
    confidence: value
```

## Key Differences from Previous Approach

### Before (Inconsistent)
- Daily Planner: 6 fields ✅
- Markets Intelligence: 1 massive field (3,282 chars) ❌
- News & Catalysts: 1 massive field (3,824 chars) ❌
- Portfolio: 2 fields (summary + 2,400 char content) ❌
- X Sentiment: Minimal stubs ❌
- Technicals: 2 fields (summary + 800 char content) ❌

**Problem**: Inconsistent visual layout, unreadable field lengths, manual update burden

### After (Unified)
- All tabs: 6 fields ✅
- All text fields: ≤600 chars ✅
- All timestamps: Current ✅
- All with sentiment + confidence ✅

**Benefit**: Unified visual experience, scannability, standardized synthesis process

## Quick Reference: Field Templates

### Summary (Market Context - ≤600 chars)
Provide situation overview, key backdrop, structural themes, and regime assessment.

**Example**: "Portfolio Signal Tier IMPROVED +28 PTS (30→58/100) = regime shift from risk-off to risk-management mode. Account balance $23,105.83, YTD +15.8%. SPX 6,656 support holding with higher lows, QQQ $604 breakout decision point. Jobless claims 8:30 AM = BINARY catalyst determining position sizing."

### Key Insight (The ONE Critical Idea - ≤600 chars)
State the single most important insight that dominates market structure TODAY.

**Example**: "SIGNAL +28 PT JUMP TO MODERATE (58/100) BUT EARNINGS QUALITY UNDER PRESSURE: Current environment justifies selective risk deployment but ONLY in quality names with strong technicals. Breadth deterioration (12.5/25) means 7 of 8 stocks still lagging—concentration risk maximal."

### Action (Specific Guidance - ≤600 chars)
Give concrete triggers, levels, allocations, and decision trees based on catalysts.

**Example**: "WAIT for 8:30 AM jobless claims. IF STRONG/IN-LINE: deploy 30-35% equities (quality + quantum), 20% crypto, 10% hedges, 35% cash. IF WEAK: maintain 25% equities max, 15% crypto, 25% hedges, 35% cash. Monitor: SPX 6,656, QQQ $604, BTC $107,600."
