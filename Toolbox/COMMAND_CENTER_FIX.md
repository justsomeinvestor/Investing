# Command Center Dashboard - Fix Report

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## What Was Wrong

Your Wingman Command Center dashboard had **stale data** causing:

### Visible Issues
1. **Red error indicator** (❌) on Trading Signal Score
2. **All breakdown bars at 0.0** (Trend, Breadth, Volatility, Technical, Seasonality)
3. **Wrong score displayed**: 28.5 (Oct 20) instead of 66.81 (Oct 26)
4. **Wrong tier**: WEAK instead of MODERATE
5. **Unknown timestamp** preventing verification

### Root Cause
The `.session_state.json` file wasn't being synced with fresh signal data from the research pipeline. Fresh signals existed in `Research/signals_2025-10-26.json` but weren't flowing back to the dashboard.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Updated `.session_state.json` Market Data

**Before:**
```json
"market": {
  "signal_tier": "WEAK",
  "signal_score": 28.5,
  "last_update": "unknown",
  "breakdown": { }  // Missing!
}
```

**After:**
```json
"market": {
  "signal_tier": "MODERATE",
  "signal_score": 66.81,
  "delta": 9.81,  // +9.81 improvement from Oct 25
  "last_updated": "2025-10-26T07:00:00Z",  // Fresh timestamp
  "breakdown": {
    "trend": 32.0,       // 40% component
    "breadth": 18.0,     // 25% component
    "volatility": 5.0,   // 20% component
    "technical": 8.3,    // 10% component
    "seasonality": 4.4   // 5% component
  }
}
```

### 2. ✅ Created Sync Utility Script

**Location:** `scripts/sync_session_state.py`

Auto-syncs session state from the latest signals file, preventing future data staleness.

## How to Use the Sync Script

### Auto-Detect Latest Signals
```bash
cd c:\Users\Iccanui\Desktop\Investing
python scripts/sync_session_state.py
```

### Use Specific Signals File
```bash
python scripts/sync_session_state.py -f Research/signals_2025-10-26.json
```

### Custom Session File Path
```bash
python scripts/sync_session_state.py -f signals_file.json -s path/to/.session_state.json
```

### Help
```bash
python scripts/sync_session_state.py --help
```

---

## Integration Points

### Run After Signal Analysis
Add to your research workflow to auto-sync:

```bash
# After signals_YYYY-MM-DD.json is created
python scripts/sync_session_state.py
# Dashboard will immediately show fresh data
```

### Wingman Commands
The sync script should be triggered by:
- `wingman dash` — Full dashboard update workflow
- Manual research update cycles
- End-of-day reporting (`wingman, eod wrap`)

---

## Technical Details

### Signal Score Mapping

The script intelligently maps the 5 trading signal components to dashboard breakdown components:

```
Trading Signal Scores  →  Dashboard Breakdown
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Macro (72)        }
  + Catalyst (88) } → Trend (40%)         = 32.0
  ÷ 2 × 0.4

Sentiment (72)         → Breadth (25%)     = 18.0
  × 0.25

Risk (-75)             → Volatility (20%)  = 5.0
  Invert & normalize

Technical (83)         → Technical (10%)   = 8.3
  × 0.1

Catalyst (88)          → Seasonality (5%)  = 4.4
  × 0.05
```

### Delta Calculation
- **Oct 25 Score**: 57.0 (from master-plan sentiment history)
- **Oct 26 Score**: 66.81 (from signals_2025-10-26.json)
- **Delta**: +9.81 (improvement)

---

## Files Modified

1. **`Journal/.session_state.json`** — Updated market object with fresh signal data
2. **`scripts/sync_session_state.py`** — New utility for automated syncing

## Files Referenced

- `Research/signals_2025-10-26.json` — Source of truth for signal data
- `master-plan/master-plan.md` — Historical sentiment scores for delta calculation
- `Journal/command-center.html` — Dashboard that displays the data

---

## Next Steps

1. **Open dashboard** in browser: `file:///c:\Users\Iccanui\Desktop\Investing\Journal\command-center.html`
2. **Verify changes**:
   - ✅ Green indicator on Trading Signal Score
   - ✅ Score shows 66.81 (MODERATE)
   - ✅ Breakdown bars populated
   - ✅ Delta shows +9.81

3. **Integrate sync script** into your daily workflow:
   - Add to `wingman dash` command
   - Run after signal analysis
   - Schedule as part of EOD updates

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard still shows old data?
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check `.session_state.json` was saved (verify timestamp is 2025-10-26T07:00:00Z)

### Sync script fails?
```bash
# Test with explicit paths
python scripts/sync_session_state.py -f Research/signals_2025-10-26.json -s Journal/.session_state.json
```

### Missing breakdown scores?
- Ensure signals file has `trading_signal_scores` object
- Check that breakdown values are > 0
- Run script with verbose output

**Dashboard is now up to speed and ready for trading! 🚀**
