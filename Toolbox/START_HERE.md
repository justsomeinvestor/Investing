# 🚀 START HERE - Project Orientation

**Welcome!** If you're reading this, you're taking over the Trading Command Center project.

**Time to read this:** 3 minutes
**Time to be productive:** 15 minutes

## ⚡ Super Quick Summary

### What We're Building
A professional trading decision engine that:
- Takes real market data
- Applies 20 CMT technical rules
- Scores probability using 5 components
- Returns BUY/WAIT/AVOID recommendations
- Manages risk mechanically

### Current Status
- ✅ **Phase 1 & 2 COMPLETE:** 21 files, full framework
- ⏳ **Phase 3 IN PROGRESS:** Building real data integration
- ❌ **Issues Found:** Engine uses simulated data (Phase 3 fixes this)

### What You Need to Do
Build Phase 3 (data integration) - about 15 hours of work

## 🎯 Your Next Task

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (In Progress)

**What's broken:**
- Engine uses hardcoded prices (fake)
- TA analysis is simulated (not real)
- Multi-timeframe confirmation missing
- Entry/stop/target use arbitrary percentages

**What you need to build:**
1. `data_fetcher.py` - Get real prices from yfinance
2. `ta_calculator.py` - Calculate real RSI, MACD, OBV
3. `pattern_detector.py` - Detect chart patterns
4. `multi_timeframe.py` - Daily/4h/1h confirmation
5. `trade_logger.py` - Log decisions for accuracy tracking

**Time estimate:** 8-15 hours total

---

## 💻 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Understand the Issue
The decision engine framework is complete, but it uses **simulated data** instead of real market data.

Example:
```python
# Current (wrong):
def _get_live_price(self, ticker: str) -> float:
    prices = {"NVDA": 192.50, "SPY": 425.00}  # HARDCODED
    return prices.get(ticker.upper(), 100.0)

# Need to fix to:
def _get_live_price(self, ticker: str) -> float:
    data = yf.Ticker(ticker)  # REAL DATA
    return float(data.info.get('currentPrice'))
```

### Step 2: Know Where to Find Help
- **"Where do I start?"** → PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md (has code templates)
- **"What are all the issues?"** → SYSTEM_REVIEW_REFINEMENTS.md
- **"What's the full picture?"** → SYSTEM_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
- **"Current status?"** → SESSION_TRACKER.md

### Step 3: Start Building
Open `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` and copy the `data_fetcher.py` code template.

That's your first 1-2 hours of work right there. It's already written!

## 🎓 Key Context You Need

### System Architecture
```
Morning:
  Scrape data → Process data → Load Wingman with all context

During Day:
  User: "Hey, analyze NVDA"
  Wingman: Calls decision engine with all loaded rules
  Engine: Returns probability score + entry/stop/target

Evening:
  Auto-generate journal entries
```

### Account Details
- Balance: $23k
- Risk per trade: 2% max ($460)
- Max concurrent trades: 5
- Win rate target: 60%+

### Technical Standard
- Python 3.8+
- Type hints for functions
- Docstrings for methods
- Error handling with logging
- Test with real data

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Must Know)

| Issue | Why It Matters | Fix Time |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Hardcoded prices | Engine uses fake data | 1-2h |
| Fake TA analysis | 40% of decision logic is wrong | 2-3h |
| No multi-timeframe | Violates CMT rules | 2-3h |
| Arbitrary stops | Risk management broken | 1-2h |
| No support/resistance | Can't calculate entry levels | 1-2h |

**All fixable.** Phase 3 fixes them. Let's go.

- Risk management framework
- CMT Level 2 rules (20 specific rules documented)
- Seasonality database (50+ years history)
- Dashboard system
- Workflow automation
- Matrix upload architecture

❌ **Needs Data Integration (Phase 3):**
- Price data fetching
- Technical indicator calculations
- Pattern recognition
- Multi-timeframe analysis
- Trade logging

## 🎯 Next 24 Hours Plan

### Hour 1-2: Understand the System
- Read the 4 essential docs (above)
- Open PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md
- See data_fetcher.py template

### Hour 2-3: Build data_fetcher.py
- Copy template from PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md
- Create `scripts/trading/data_fetcher.py`
- Test with real ticker (NVDA)
- Verify output matches market

### Hour 3-4: Document & Commit
- Update SESSION_TRACKER.md with progress
- Add entry to DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
- Commit code with clear message
- Mark todo as completed

**Then:** Continue with ta_calculator.py (next 2-3 hours)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Code is already written** - Check PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md, copy templates
2. **Test against manual analysis** - Compare engine output to TradingView charts
3. **Document as you go** - Update SESSION_TRACKER.md each session
4. **Use real market data** - Test with actual tickers, not simulated
5. **Keep it modular** - Each file should be testable independently
