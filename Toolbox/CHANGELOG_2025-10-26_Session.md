## Features & Enhancements

### 1. Options Intelligence Redesign → Unusual Activity Monitor
**Objective:** Transform static options metrics into actionable unusual activity detection

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Created `analyze_options_activity.py`** - New Python module for detecting unusual options patterns
  - Compares current day vs previous day's options metrics
  - Detects SPIKE alerts (>20% change)
  - Detects ELEVATED alerts (10-20% change)
  - Flags P/C ratio extremes (>1.8 = bearish, <0.6 = bullish)
  - Identifies IV percentile extremes (>80th or <20th percentile)
  - Tracks max pain shifts (>$5 change indicates dealer repositioning)

- ✅ **Integrated into `sync_technicals_tab.py`**
  - Runs automatically during wingman dash Phase 2
  - Analyzer called after technical data is synced
  - Stores results in `tabs.technicals.unusualActivity`
  - Automatically sets `unusualActivity.updatedAt` timestamp

- ✅ **Added `renderUnusualActivityMonitor()` to dashboard**
  - Displays alert cards with color-coded severity (RED=SPIKE, ORANGE=ELEVATED)
  - Shows metric, current value, previous value, and interpretation
  - Only renders when alerts exist (no noise when market is normal)
  - Positioned in left column of technicals tab below Bitcoin Technicals

- ✅ **Removed redundant Options Intelligence section**
  - Deleted volume flow visualization (duplicate of P/C ratio data)
  - Removed stale optionsAIInterpretation display (6+ days old)
  - Deleted `renderOptionsIntelligence()` function

**Result:** Options data now provides real-time alerts when unusual market activity is detected

### 2. Markets Intelligence Tab Restructuring
**Objective:** Reorganize for better information hierarchy and Daily Planner cleanup

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Moved Analyst Consensus to Markets Intelligence**
  - Previously in Daily Planner
  - Now at top-left of Markets Intelligence tab
  - Shows sentiment badges (BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL) with themes
  - Color-coded borders match sentiment direction

- ✅ **Moved Risk & Divergence Monitor to Markets Intelligence**
  - Previously in Daily Planner
  - Now at top-right of Markets Intelligence tab
  - Displays CRITICAL (red), HIGH (orange), and technical risks
  - Each alert shows theme, description, and color-coded severity

- ✅ **Positioned side-by-side layout**
  - Both sections use flexbox with `gap: 20px`
  - Responsive: wraps on smaller screens
  - Each takes ~50% width on desktop
  - Maintained with status badge (freshness indicator)

- ✅ **Kept 3 dropdown sections below consensus/risk**
  - Macro Environment
  - Crypto Markets
  - Tech & Innovation
  - Order preserved from before

- ✅ **Cleaned up Daily Planner**
  - Removed Analyst Consensus
  - Removed Risk & Divergence Monitor
  - Kept End of Day Recap (daily planner-specific content)
  - Simplified Daily Planner focus

**Result:** Markets Intelligence now primary home for market analysis; Daily Planner focused on planning-specific content

---

### 3. Economic Calendar Enhancement
**Objective:** Make calendar less overwhelming while keeping key info visible

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Created `renderEconomicTimelineCollapsible()`**
  - Full calendar content hidden by default when collapsed
  - Shows abbreviated TODAY + UPCOMING events when collapsed
  - TODAY events highlighted in green
  - UPCOMING limited to 5 next events
  - Expandable to full calendar for detailed view

- ✅ **Implemented state persistence**
  - Uses localStorage to remember collapsed/expanded state
  - Unique ID per calendar instance
  - Toggle arrow shows current state (▶ collapsed, ▼ expanded)
  - Persist across page reloads

- ✅ **Styling updates**
  - Clickable header with cursor pointer
  - Smooth transitions
  - Consistent color scheme with rest of dashboard
  - Minimal spacing (user requested)

**Result:** Calendar no longer clutters Markets Intelligence; users can expand when needed

---

### 4. Verification System Expansion
**Objective:** Track more sections to ensure data freshness

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ **Added `tabs.technicals.unusualActivity.updatedAt`**
  - Now verified that unusual activity analysis runs
  - Ensures timestamp updated during Phase 2 sync
  - Detected if analysis becomes stale (>12 hours old)

- ✅ **Updated verification statistics**
  - Total tracked fields: 26 → **27** (79% coverage)
  - Phase 2 automated: 13 → **14** fields
  - Expected health post-Phase 2: 50% → **52%**

- ✅ **Verification confirmed working**
  - Test run shows `tabs.technicals.unusualActivity.updatedAt: 2025-10-26T12:54:45Z` as CURRENT
  - Full health: 27/27 sections current (100%)

**Result:** Unusual activity section now monitored for freshness; dashboard health reflects this

---

## Documentation Updates

### Verification Field Registry (`verification_field_registry.md`)
- Updated coverage: 26/34 → **27/34** (76% → 79%)
- Updated health status: 100% (26/26) → **100% (27/27)**

## Testing & Verification

### Unusual Activity Analyzer
- ✅ Tested with 2025-10-26 data
- ✅ Correctly detects QQQ P/C ratio as ELEVATED (1.80)
- ✅ SPY shows no unusual activity (normal positioning)
- ✅ Analyzer handles missing previous day data gracefully

### Dashboard Rendering
- ✅ Markets Intelligence tab shows new layout
- ✅ Analyst Consensus and Risk Monitor side-by-side
- ✅ Unusual Activity Monitor appears in left column
- ✅ Economic Calendar collapsible and responsive

### Verification System
- ✅ 27/27 fields show as CURRENT (100% health)
- ✅ Unusual activity timestamp recognized and validated
- ✅ All Phase 2 fields updated automatically during sync

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Economic Calendar** - Abbreviated view shows only next 5 upcoming events
   - Could be made configurable per user preference

2. **Unusual Activity Detection** - Requires previous day's data
   - First day of tracking shows no comparisons
   - Fixed: analyzer handles gracefully with no-comparison detection

3. **Risk & Divergence Monitor** - Now only in Markets Intelligence
   - Daily Planner lost visibility of these alerts
   - Trade-off: simplified Daily Planner, dedicated Markets Intelligence section

### Future Enhancements
- Add user configurable thresholds for SPIKE/ELEVATED detection
- Implement unusual activity trend (direction of change)
- Add visual indicators (arrows) for P/C ratio direction changes
- Create historical view of unusual activity (when did alerts trigger this week?)
- Add email/notification alerts for SPIKE-level unusual activity

---

## Workflow Impact

### Daily Operations (wingman dash)
**Before:**
- Phase 2 synced redundant options metrics (volume flow = P/C ratio)
- Daily Planner cluttered with market analysis sections
- Economic Calendar took up too much space
- No detection of unusual options activity

**After:**
- Phase 2 now includes intelligent options activity analysis
- Markets Intelligence focuses on market trends
- Daily Planner focuses on portfolio decisions
- Economic Calendar space-efficient with collapsible design
- Real-time alerts when unusual options activity detected

### Verification Checks
- **Before:** 26 fields tracked (76% coverage)
- **After:** 27 fields tracked (79% coverage)
- Unusual activity now monitored: must be updated during Phase 2
- If stale (>12 hours old): indicates analysis wasn't run

**Major Wins:**
✅ Options intelligence transformed from static → actionable alerts
✅ Markets Intelligence tab fully reorganized and optimized
