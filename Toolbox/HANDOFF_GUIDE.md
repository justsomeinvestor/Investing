# Trading Command Center - Handoff Guide

**Prepared for:** Next AI Contractor / Development Team
**Created:** 2025-10-19
**Project Phase:** Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2 Development
**Lead AI Transition:** From initial AI to next AI contractor

---

## Welcome to the Trading Command Center Project

This guide will help you understand the complete vision, current state, and next steps for this AI-powered trading system. The project is well-structured and ready for continuation.

---

## Part 1: Understanding the Vision

### 1.1 What Are We Building?

An integrated AI trading system where:
- **Morning Ritual:** Data is scraped, processed, and loaded into Wingman's memory (Matrix upload)
- **During Day:** User mentions tickers → Wingman analyzes with full context (rules + data + sentiment)
- **End of Day:** Wingman auto-generates journal entries and resets for next session

### 1.2 The Three Pillars

**Pillar 1: Command Center Hub**
- Unified operational dashboard (HTML)
- Real-time account & market metrics
- Quick command access
- Decision support interface

**Pillar 2: Automated Workflows**
- Morning data → processing → dashboard update
- Daily prospecting → EOD journal generation
- Weekly planning → daily execution cascade

**Pillar 3: Intelligence Engine**
- CMT Level 2 technical analysis rules
- Probability scoring framework
- Real-time ticker analysis
- Rule-based decision support

### 1.3 The User's Mental Model

The user thinks of this system as a **"Matrix upload"** - like loading martial arts training into Neo's brain. Each morning:
1. Intelligence is collected (price, sentiment, news)
2. Dashboard is updated with that intelligence
3. Wingman persona is "loaded" with all that intelligence + trading rules
4. Throughout the day, when analyzing trades, Wingman has complete context

       + (0.15 × Sentiment_Score)
       + (0.10 × Volume_Score)
       + (0.10 × Seasonality_Score)

Output: 0-100 scale
- 0-33: AVOID
- 34-66: WAIT
- 67-100: BUY
```

**For Each Component (TA, Context, Sentiment, Volume, Seasonality):**
- Definition

#### Component 5: Real-Time Analysis Engine
**File:** `scripts/trading/analyze_ticker.py`
**Functionality:**
- Input: Ticker symbol (e.g., "NVDA")
- Output: BUY/WAIT/AVOID + probability score + thesis + entry/stop/target
- Process:
  1. Fetch live price (Yahoo Finance)
  2. Get market context (from loaded master-plan.md)
  3. Check X sentiment (latest from Research/X/)
  4. Apply CMT rules (from Toolbox/Rules/)
  5. Web search for catalysts
  6. Look up seasonality
  7. Calculate probability score
  8. Determine levels

**Example Output:**
```
TICKER: NVDA
SIGNAL: WAIT
PROBABILITY: 68%

THESIS: Break above resistance with volume.
Wait for SPY confirmation above 600.
If confirmed, high probability continuation to 198.50.

ENTRY: 192.50
STOP: 190.00
TARGET: 198.50
R:R: 1:3.3
```

**Expected Integration:** Callable from Wingman persona when user mentions ticker

---

#### Component 6: Matrix Upload System
**File:** `scripts/trading/matrix_upload.py`
**Functionality:**
- Triggered by: "Load Wingman" command
- Loads into memory:
  - Account state (balance, positions, YTD)
  - Master plan (today's signal analysis)
  - Dashboard metrics (all current numbers)
  - Weekly/daily plans (this week's setup + today's priorities)
  - All trading rules (TA, seasonality, probability, risk mgmt)
  - X sentiment data (latest)
- Output: "✓ Full context ingested. Ready to analyze tickers."

**Expected Integration:** Wingman can recall any rule or data point during day without external lookup

---

#### Component 7: Planners Tab Integration
**File:** `master-plan/research-dashboard.html` (edit existing)
**Changes:**
- Rename "Daily Planner" tab to "Planners"
- Add two sections:
  - **Weekly Planner** (reads from `Research/AI/[WEEK]_WEEKLY_METRICS.md`)
  - **Daily Planner** (reads from `Research/AI/[DATE]_DAILY_METRICS.md`)
- Display weekly forecast + trigger stack at top
- Display today's priorities + key levels below
- Auto-refresh from files

**Expected Result:** User can view week's strategy + today's execution in one tab

## Part 5: Critical Context for Next AI

### 5.1 User's Trading Style (Inferred)

From the system design, the user:
- Trades technical setups (CMT Level 2 standard means chart patterns, trend, momentum)
- Uses options/derivatives (probability scoring suggests options analysis)
- Trades equities and commodities (references ES, SPY, QQQ, BTC)
- Likes structured processes (Sunday planner, daily ritual, automated workflows)
- Wants rules-based decisions (no "gut feel" - all decisions backed by probability scoring)
- Values context (insists all data loads before analysis - Matrix upload pattern)
- Works intraday (mentions SPY key levels, 5-min candles in examples)

### 5.2 User's Values (Inferred)

- **Consistency:** Rules applied every time, no exceptions
- **Automation:** Morning ritual runs automatically, EOD wrap is automatic, Wingman loads automatically
- **Context:** Everything is loaded before trading, full state visible at all times
- **Speed:** Real-time analysis, quick access to commands, visual dashboard for fast scanning
- **Accountability:** Every trade recorded, journal auto-generated, P&L tracked

### 5.3 Key Assumptions to Preserve

1. **Yahoo Finance API is acceptable for price data** (free tier)
2. **X sentiment scraper already exists** (don't rebuild)
3. **Master plan workflow already exists** (run daily)
4. **CMT Level 2 standards apply** (not Level 1, not other systems)
5. **Probability scoring weights:** 40/25/15/10/10 (TA/Context/Sentiment/Volume/Seasonality)
6. **R:R minimum:** 1:2 (implied from examples)
7. **Position sizing:** Account-based, risk-based (specific formula TBD with user)

### 5.4 Technical Debt (None - Phase 1 is Clean)

- ✅ No broken file references
- ✅ All markdown properly formatted
- ✅ HTML responsive and styled consistently
- ✅ No placeholder values
- ✅ Architecture well-documented
- ✅ Integration points clearly mapped

## Part 8: Questions to Clarify with User

Before starting Phase 2, consider asking:

1. **Position Sizing:** What account size should we assume? What % risk per trade? (User's account: $20k+ based on examples, but confirm)

2. **Minimum R:R:** Is 1:2 the minimum acceptable? Or should it be higher?

3. **Probability Threshold:** What's minimum probability to take a trade? (60%? 65%? 70%?)

4. **Web Search Integration:** Which news sources should we prioritize? (Yahoo Finance news, seeking Alpha, Twitter/X?)

5. **Data Availability:** Is the X sentiment scraper still running? Can we verify format of data?

6. **API Keys:** Where should we store API keys for Yahoo Finance? (Environment variables? Config file?)

7. **Error Handling:** If market data is unavailable, should we use cached data or refuse analysis?

8. **Trade Logging:** Should analysis scores be logged to file for backtesting?
