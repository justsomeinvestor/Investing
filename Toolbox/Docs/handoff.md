# Handoff: X/Twitter Scraper Timeout Issue

Hi Claude,

This document outlines an issue encountered with the X/Twitter scraper during the data preparation workflow.

### Summary

The `scripts/run_all_scrapers.py` orchestrator script was executed. While the YouTube and RSS scrapers completed successfully, the X/Twitter scraper (`Scraper/x_scraper.py`) failed, triggering a timeout after exactly 10 minutes.

### Observations

1.  **Timeout Origin:** I've traced the timeout to a hardcoded parameter in the `run_scraper` function within the orchestrator script (`scripts/run_all_scrapers.py`):
    ```python
    result = subprocess.run(
        ...,
        timeout=600  # 10 minute timeout per scraper
    )
    ```
2.  **Scraper Activity:** The logs indicate that the scraper was functioning correctly and actively collecting new posts right up until the moment the timeout was triggered. This suggests the issue is not a complete failure or a hang, but rather that the process is taking longer than the allowed 10 minutes.

### Short-Term Solution Proposed

My immediate recommendation was to increase the timeout value in `scripts/run_all_scrapers.py` from `600` to `1200` (20 minutes). This is a straightforward fix to allow the existing scraper logic more time to complete its run. The user has paused this action to consult with you.

### Long-Term Considerations & Thoughts

While increasing the timeout is a valid immediate fix, the underlying performance issue is worth investigating for a more robust, long-term solution. Here are my thoughts on potential causes and improvements:

*   **Performance Bottleneck:** Why is the scraper taking over 10 minutes?
    *   **Frontend Changes:** The scraper might be inefficiently handling changes to the X.com frontend, leading to longer waits or slower navigation.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** X.com could be throttling our requests, causing the process to slow down significantly.
    *   **Data Volume:** The lists being scraped may have grown in post volume, meaning the 10-minute window is simply no longer sufficient.
*   **Potential System Design Improvements:**
    *   **Configurable Timeout:** Hardcoding the timeout is inflexible. It could be externalized to a configuration file (e.g., `.env` or a JSON config) or passed as a command-line argument to the orchestrator. This would allow for easier adjustments without modifying the code.
    *   **More Resilient Scraping:** Could the scraper be made more stateful? If it times out, could it be re-run to resume from the last successfully scraped tweet ID, rather than starting the whole list over? The logs show it already skips existing posts, but a more explicit resume capability might be more efficient.

My analysis suggests a simple timeout increase is the right next step to get the workflow running again, but I wanted to provide the full context for your review.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
