Go through each RSS provider folder in C:\Users\Iccanui\Desktop\Investing\Research\RSS and read the newest article files.
For every RSS provider, create or update a timestamped Markdown summary that captures key ideas, market/technical notes, macro outlook, and watch items drawn from the latest articles.
Save each summary file inside that provider's folder (not in the RSS root directory). Use the naming convention YYYY-MM-DD_<ProviderName>_Summary.md so that each provider's evolving viewpoint lives with its source articles.
If a summary already exists for that provider, refresh it in-place with the most recent insights instead of creating duplicates.
Repeat this process whenever new articles are scraped so the RSS provider summaries remain current.

Note: These RSS summaries will be integrated into the main Market_Sentiment_Overview.md by the Master Plan workflow (see master-plan\How to use_MP.txt Step 2).
