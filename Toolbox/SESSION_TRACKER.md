## 🔍 Critical Findings from Review

### Key Issues to Fix (Priority)

#### 1. CRITICAL - Data Sources (8 hours)
**Current:** Hardcoded prices
**Problem:** Engine uses NVDA=$192.50, SPY=$425.00 (fake)
**Fix:** Use yfinance API (code template provided in PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md)
**Impact:** 40% of entire engine depends on this

#### 2. CRITICAL - TA Calculations (3-4 hours)
**Current:** Simulated TA scores
**Problem:** Doesn't calculate RSI, MACD, OBV - just guesses
**Fix:** Implement real indicator calculations (template in roadmap)
**Impact:** 40% of probability formula depends on this

#### 3. CRITICAL - Multi-Timeframe (2-3 hours)
**Current:** Only daily analysis
**Problem:** CMT Level 2 rules REQUIRE 2+ timeframe confirmation
**Fix:** Add 4h and 1h analysis with alignment check
**Impact:** Violates system's own rules

#### 4. CRITICAL - Entry/Stop/Target (2 hours)
**Current:** Arbitrary percentages (1% stop, 3% target)
**Problem:** Violates Risk_Management_Rules (should use logical levels)
**Fix:** Detect support/resistance and place at chart levels
**Impact:** Position risk/reward becomes meaningful

#### 5. CRITICAL - Support/Resistance (1-2 hours)
**Current:** Not implemented
**Problem:** Can't determine entry/stop/target without levels
**Fix:** Find peaks/troughs from price history
**Impact:** Entire level determination depends on this

#### 6. HIGH - Trade Logging (2 hours)
**Current:** No logging
**Problem:** Can't measure if system works
**Fix:** Log all decisions with component scores + actual outcomes
**Impact:** Can't improve or optimize without data

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Built Next

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 1)

#### Task 3.1: data_fetcher.py (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Dependency:** None (can start immediately)

**What It Does:**
- Fetches real prices from yfinance
- Calculates 20-day volume average
- Gets SPY/QQQ context
- Handles caching (5-min TTL)
- Error recovery

**Code Template:** Provided in PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md (410 lines)
**Testing:** Run with different tickers, verify output matches market data

**Success Criteria:**
- get_current_price('NVDA') returns real price
- get_price_history() returns 100 days of OHLCV
- Caching works (same data on consecutive calls)
- Handles API errors gracefully

---

#### Task 3.2: ta_calculator.py (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Dependency:** data_fetcher.py

**What It Does:**
- Calculate RSI from prices
- Calculate MACD (line, signal, histogram)
- Calculate OBV
- Calculate moving averages (EMA 20, 50, 200)
- Detect trend direction

**Key Formulas:**
```
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
  where RS = AvgGain / AvgLoss

MACD = EMA12 - EMA26
Signal = EMA9(MACD)
Histogram = MACD - Signal

OBV = Sum(Volume on up days) - Sum(Volume on down days)
```

**Testing:**
- RSI at overbought (>70) and oversold (<30)
- MACD crossovers
- OBV trend matching price trend

**Success Criteria:**
- RSI values between 0-100
- MACD crossovers detected correctly
- Trend identification accurate

---

#### Task 3.3: pattern_detector.py (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Difficulty:** Hard (requires pattern recognition)
**Dependency:** ta_calculator.py, data_fetcher.py

**What It Does:**
- Detect Head & Shoulders patterns
- Detect triangle patterns (ascending, descending, symmetrical)
- Detect flag/pennant patterns
- Detect support/resistance levels
- Map patterns to CMT rules base scores

**Algorithm:**
```
For each candlestick:
  - Find local peaks (resistance)
  - Find local troughs (support)
  - Look for pattern combinations
  - Match against known patterns
  - Calculate pattern height for target projection
```

**Testing:**
- Test on known H&S setups
- Test on known triangles
- Verify support/resistance matches visual inspection

**Success Criteria:**
- Correctly identifies patterns on test data
- S/R levels match manual chart analysis
- Pattern measurements accurate for target calculation

---

#### Task 3.4: multi_timeframe.py (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Dependency:** ta_calculator.py, pattern_detector.py

**What It Does:**
- Analyze daily timeframe
- Analyze 4-hour timeframe
- Analyze 1-hour timeframe
- Verify all 3 timeframes aligned
- Calculate confirmation score

**CMT Requirement:**
"Before entry, MUST confirm on at least TWO timeframes"

**Testing:**
- Verify daily uptrend matches 4hr uptrend
- Verify 1hr candle in correct direction
- Score alignment properly

**Success Criteria:**
- Multi-timeframe analysis runs without errors
- Confirmation score reflects alignment
- Rejects setups where timeframes don't align

---

#### Task 3.5: trade_logger.py (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Time:** 2 hours
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Dependency:** analyze_ticker.py

**What It Does:**
- Log all decisions to JSON file
- Log component scores (TA, context, sentiment, volume, seasonality)
- Log entry/stop/target levels
- Log actual trade entry/exit
- Calculate accuracy metrics

**Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T14:30:00",
  "ticker": "NVDA",
  "decision": {
    "probability_score": 71,
    "signal": "BUY",
    "components": {
      "ta": 95,
      "context": 55,
      "sentiment": 40,
      "volume": 50,
      "seasonality": 55
    }
  },
  "levels": {
    "entry": 192.50,
    "stop": 190.00,
    "target": 198.50
  },
  "actual": {
    "entry": 192.55,
    "exit": 198.45,
    "profit": 485.00,
    "outcome": "WIN"
  }
}
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All decisions logged
- Can query: "How many 70+ probability trades won?"
- Can measure component accuracy

#### Session 3 (CURRENT - Phase 3 Implementation)
**Lead AI:** Claude (Haiku 4.5)
**Duration:** In progress
**Date:** 2025-10-19

**Objectives:**
- Build Background Data Collector System
- Integrate Finnhub API (key: cvb0g99r01qgjh3v2pcgcvb0g99r01qgjh3v2pd0)
- Create Command Center control panel
- Implement ticker watchlist management
- Add START/STOP buttons for manual control
- Cache system for fast data access

**Design Decisions Made:**
- ✅ Use Finnhub API as primary data source
- ✅ 5-minute update interval for all tickers
- ✅ Always track SPY + QQQ (hardcoded)
- ✅ User adds/removes tickers via Command Center UI
- ✅ Manual START/STOP controls (buttons in Command Center)
- ✅ JSON file caching (data/cache/)
- ✅ Background service runs independently
- ✅ Decision engine reads from cache first (instant analysis)

**User Preferences:**
- "Make Command Center a bunch of buttons for manual processes"
- "We can automate later"
- "Sounds fun" - wants interactive control
- Intraday + swing trading (both)
- No yfinance (rate limits too much)

**Status:** READY TO BUILD (Plan complete, awaiting execution)
