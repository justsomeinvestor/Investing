## 📊 Test Results Interpretation

### Pass Rate Thresholds
| Range | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 100% | ✅ EXCELLENT | Release to production |
| 90-99% | ✅ GOOD | Review failures, minor issues only |
| 80-89% | ⚠️ OK | Fix failures before next phase |
| < 80% | ❌ FAIL | Critical issues, must fix |

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Console Errors" test fails**
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages
- Look for JavaScript errors
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Common causes: missing files, syntax errors

**Issue: "localStorage Support" fails**
- Browser may be in private/incognito mode
- Storage quota exceeded
- Browser doesn't support localStorage (very rare)
- Solution: Use different browser or disable privacy mode

**Issue: "Load Time" is slow (> 2 seconds)**
- Check network tab for slow resources
- May be server/network issue, not code issue
- Retry test - network latency varies
- Check for render-blocking resources

**Issue: Mobile view looks broken**
- Check if viewport meta tag is present
- Verify media queries are working
- Look for fixed-width elements (should be %)
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just emulator
