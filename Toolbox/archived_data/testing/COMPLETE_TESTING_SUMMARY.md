## 🧪 What Each Test Really Checks

### "Command Center Loads"
**Checks:** HTML file renders without JavaScript errors
**Why:** Foundation test - if page won't load, nothing works
**Failure Means:** Major syntax error or missing file

### "Analysis Panel Exists"
**Checks:** The div that displays trade analysis is in DOM
**Why:** Core feature depends on this panel
**Failure Means:** HTML structure broken or panel missing

### "Test Buttons Present"
**Checks:** All 6 test action buttons are on the page
**Why:** Needed to test analysis display
**Failure Means:** Buttons not rendered or missing

### "localStorage Support"
**Checks:** Browser allows saving to localStorage
**Why:** PIN feature depends on persistent storage
**Failure Means:** Browser too old or private mode enabled

### "JSON Files Load"
**Checks:** account_state.json, positions.json, Journal.md exist and load
**Why:** These are data sources
**Failure Means:** Files missing or unreadable

### "Data Pipeline" (6 steps)
**Checks:** End-to-end process from data load to UI display
**Why:** Validates complete workflow
**Failure Means:** Problem in data flow chain

### "Cache System"
**Checks:** Can write/read data and expiration works
**Why:** Improves performance by reusing data
**Failure Means:** localStorage not working

### "Live Data"
**Checks:** Can fetch and format real-time data
**Why:** Ensures data is fresh and correct
**Failure Means:** API issue or data format problem

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| All tests FAIL | Server not running | `python -m http.server 8888` |
| "Loads" test fails | HTML syntax error | Check browser console (F12) |
| "Panel" test fails | HTML missing element | Verify command-center.html intact |
| "Buttons" test fails | Not rendered | Check CSS display property |
| "localStorage" fails | Private mode | Use normal browsing mode |
| "JSON" test fails | Files missing | Verify files in directory |
| "Pipeline" fails on step 1 | JSON syntax error | Validate JSON: jsonlint.com |
| "Pipeline" fails on step 3 | Analysis algorithm | Check JavaScript in console |
| "Cache" test fails | localStorage disabled | Allow storage in browser |
| Load time slow | Network latency | Retry - varies with connection |
| Mobile test fails | Not tested on device | Use DevTools emulator |
