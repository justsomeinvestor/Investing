## 2025-10-19 - Session 2: System Review & Phase 3 Planning

### Entry 1: Initial System Review
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-19 14:00 UTC
**AI:** Claude (Haiku 4.5)
**Task:** Comprehensive system review for production readiness

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Analyzed all 21 files created in Phase 2
- ✅ Identified 17 issues (5 critical, 5 high, 3 medium, 4 design)
- ✅ Severity ratings and fix time estimates
- ✅ Created detailed flaw analysis document

**Key Findings:**
- Engine uses hardcoded prices (NVDA=$192.50, SPY=$425.00)
- TA calculations are simulated (doesn't calculate RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Multi-timeframe confirmation not implemented
- Entry/stop/target use arbitrary percentages instead of chart levels
- No trade logging system

**Estimated Impact:**
- Critical issues: ~15 hours to fix
- High issues: ~4 hours
- Medium issues: ~3 hours
- Total: 22 hours to production-ready

**Issues Encountered:** None (analysis-only phase)

**Next Steps:**
1. Create production roadmap with code templates
2. Create session tracking system
3. Start Phase 3 implementation (data integration)

---

## 2025-10-19 - Session 3: Background Data Collector (PLANNING COMPLETE)

### Entry 1: Architecture Decision & API Selection
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-19 16:00 UTC
**AI:** Claude (Haiku 4.5)
**Task:** Design background data collection system with user input

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Reviewed user requirements (intraday + swing, manual control, Finnhub API)
- ✅ Designed complete Background Data Collector architecture
- ✅ Created Command Center control panel design
- ✅ Planned 6 new Python modules
- ✅ Designed JSON cache format
- ✅ Integrated with decision engine workflow
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Finnhub API as primary (not yfinance - rate limits)
- 5-minute update interval for all tickers
- JSON caching (simplest, effective)
- Manual START/STOP buttons in Command Center (not auto)
- Always track SPY + QQQ (hardcoded, can't remove)
- Background service runs independently from engine

**Finnhub Integration:**
- API Key: cvb0g99r01qgjh3v2pcgcvb0g99r01qgjh3v2pd0
- Free tier: 60 calls/min
- Endpoints: /quote, /stock/candle, /indicator
- Fallback: Yahoo Finance scraping if API fails

**User Preferences Captured:**
- "Make Command Center like a bunch of buttons"
- "Sounds fun" - wants interactive manual control
- "We can automate later"
- Intraday + swing trading
- No yfinance (rate limits)

**Expected Implementation (Next Phase):**
- `data_collector.py` - Background service (2 hours)
- `api_sources.py` - Finnhub integration (1.5 hours)
- `ticker_manager.py` - Watchlist management (1 hour)
- `cache_manager.py` - JSON caching (1 hour)
- `command-center.html` - UI updates (1.5 hours)
- `analyze_ticker.py` - Cache integration (1 hour)
- Testing & integration (2 hours)
- **Total: ~9 hours**

**Architecture Planned:**
```
Command Center UI → START/STOP/ADD/REMOVE buttons
       ↓
Background Service (data_collector.py)
       ↓ (every 5 min)
Finnhub API ← Fetch price/volume
       ↓
Calculate indicators (RSI, MACD, OBV, MAs)
       ↓
Cache to JSON (data/cache/[TICKER].json)
       ↓
Decision Engine (reads cache instantly)
```

**Next Step:** Implementation of all 6 modules + Command Center updates

- ✅ Updated DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md with this session's work
- ✅ Documented all design decisions made
- ✅ Recorded API key and preferences
- ✅ Captured estimated time breakdown
- ✅ Set up clear entry point for next AI
