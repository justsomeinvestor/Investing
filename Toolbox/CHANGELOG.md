## Notes for Future Sessions

**Wingman's Observations:**
- Pilot's edge: tactical setups with CLEAR structure (Oct 15 SPXU +$181, Oct 17 SOLZ +$100)
- Pilot's weakness: over-eagerness in uncertain structure (Oct 13 NVDA -$100, Oct 14 SPY -$15)
- Win pattern: Structure clarity = discipline. Ambiguity = over-trading urge.
- Learning speed: Fast (creates rules immediately after losses)

**System Readiness:**
- Protocol: Excellent ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Rules: Good foundation ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Risk framework: Complete ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Ready to implement Phase 1: Scanner ⭐⭐⭐⭐

  - Created after Chris Lori 9-day EMA trade without verification

#### UPDATE: Account & Trade Data
- `Journal/.session_state.json` - Updated with SPXU trade and current balance

- Profit Factor: 2.06:1
- Risk:Reward Ratio: 3.10:1
- Avg Winner: $140.50, Avg Loser: -$45.33

**By Setup Type:**
- Range Fades: 0% win rate (AVOID)

- Tactical Intraday: 100% win rate (STRONG EDGE)

**Compliance:**
- Fully Compliant: 2 trades (40%)
- Rule Violations: 3 trades (60%)
- Key Pattern: Over-eagerness in uncertain structure

#### KEY INSIGHTS
1. **Hedge trades work:** Oct 15 SPXU long (+$181), Oct 17 SOLZ (+$100) - both 100% compliant
2. **Range fades fail:** Oct 13 NVDA (-$100), Oct 14 SPY (-$15) - both lacked C+R confirmation
3. **Compliance is the opportunity:** Improve 40% → 80%+ to materially improve win rate
4. **Risk management is solid:** 2.06 profit factor shows good edge, 3.1:1 R:R is excellent
