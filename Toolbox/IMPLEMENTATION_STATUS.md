## Known Limitations & Workarounds

**Limitation 1:** Yahoo Finance API has rate limits
- **Workaround:** Cache prices for 5 minutes, use batch endpoints

**Limitation 2:** X sentiment data depends on scraper availability
- **Workaround:** Fall back to text-only analysis if X data unavailable

**Limitation 3:** Web search for catalysts may return irrelevant results
- **Workaround:** Filter by date range (last 24 hours), verify source credibility

**Limitation 4:** Seasonality data is historical, not predictive
- **Workaround:** Use as 10% weight only, not primary signal

## Recommended Next Steps for Phase 2 Lead

1. **Start with Rules Foundation** (CMT TA Rules + Seasonality)
   - These are independent and can be researched in parallel
   - Web research phase takes time; start early

2. **Then Build Probability Framework**
   - Depends on rules being defined
   - Scoring formula needs examples from both rules

3. **Then Build Real-Time Analysis Engine**
   - Depends on framework being complete
   - This is the most complex component

4. **Then Build Matrix Upload**
   - Depends on all rule files existing
   - Can be done while testing analysis engine

5. **Finally, Integrate Dashboard**
   - Depends on all other components being done
   - Polish and refinement work
