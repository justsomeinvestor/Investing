- Current P&L
- Setup type

✅ **Your Thinking**
- Exact words (blockquote)

---

## 📊 Example: Reading Your Journal

**In Command Center, you see:**
```
SQQQ Short - Entry: $14.33

Raw Notes:
"A soul that we were coming up into not last week's high
but the previous week's high and it started to look like
it was a little bit weak like it might roll over..."

Setup: Consolidation Mean Reversion / CPI Event Fade
State: 🟢 Confident, Planned
```

**What this tells you:**
- You identified consolidation near resistance
- You planned it (not reactive)
- You considered event risk (CPI)
- You're confident in mean reversion setup

**Next morning, you learn:**
- This setup worked 75% of the time historically
- Morning entries are your 82% edge
- You risked 46% account on this (high for mean reversion)
- Growth area: Tighter position sizing on setups with event risk

---

## 🌟 Pro Tips

### 1. Be Specific When Trading
**Instead of:** "Entered SQQQ short"
**Say:** "Entered SQQQ short at 14.33, consolidation above 15 showing weakness, CPI Friday event risk favors range bound"

This gives more detail for pattern analysis.

### 2. Update Daily
Run parser every day: `python scripts/journal/parse_live_session.py`
Keeps your journal data fresh and accessible.

### 3. Review Weekly
Every Sunday, open Command Center and review:
- Your best setups this week
- Your best times to trade
- What cost you the most money
- What you'll do different next week

### 4. Track Patterns Over Time
The more you journal, the clearer patterns emerge:
- Your personal edge (what works FOR YOU)
- Your optimal conditions
- Your mistakes to avoid
- Your edge window timing

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Where is my journal data stored?**
A: In `Journal/LIVE_SESSION_2025-10-20.md` (markdown file). It's human-readable and editable.

**Q: How often is Command Center updated?**
A: Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds, or immediately after you run the parser.

**Q: Can I edit the markdown file directly?**
A: Yes! It's plain text. Just edit `LIVE_SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md` directly if needed.

**Q: What if the parser misses something?**
A: Edit the markdown file, then re-run parser to update JSON with corrections.
