# Paper Trading System - Complete Integration Guide
**Status:** OPERATIONAL
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Version:** 1.0 (Production Ready)

---

## Overview

You have a **complete, fully-operational paper trading system** already built and integrated. This guide explains how it all works together and how to use it.

**The System:**
- Conversational trade logging (tell Wingman trades naturally)
- Automatic position tracking (positions.json)
- Account state management (account_state.json)
- Real-time P&L calculation
- EOD wrap automation (captures trades to journal)
- Command Center display integration

---

## System Architecture

### The Flow

```

    ↓
Wingman Parses (wingman_commander.py)
    ↓
State Manager Updates (state_manager.py)
    ├─ Add position to positions.json
    ├─ Update cash in account_state.json
    └─ Calculate P&L
    ↓
Command Center Displays Live Status
    ↓
EOD Wrap Captures to Journal
    ├─ Reads closed_positions from positions.json
    ├─ Calculates daily P&L
    └─ Creates journal entry with all trades
    ↓
Account Balance Updated for Next Session
```

## How It Works

### 1. Opening a Trade

**You say:**
```
"Opened QQQ long 100 @ $601.25, stop 600, target 604"
```

**What happens:**
1. Wingman parses the trade (ticker, direction, shares, price, stop, target)
2. State manager validates:
   - ✓ Direction is "long" or "short"
   - ✓ Shares > 0
   - ✓ Sufficient cash available ($60,125 needed)
3. Position is added to `positions.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ticker": "QQQ",
     "direction": "long",
     "shares": 100,
     "entry_price": 601.25,
     "entry_time": "2025-10-27T14:30:00Z",
     "stop_loss": 600.00,
     "target": 604.00,
     "signal_tier": "MODERATE",
     "signal_score": 55,
     "current_price": 601.25,
     "unrealized_pnl": 0,
     "unrealized_pnl_pct": 0
   }
   ```
4. Cash is deducted from `account_state.json`:
   - Before: $23,105.83 cash
   - After: $23,105.83 - $60,125 = -$37,019.17 (invested)
   - Available cash recalculated

5. Wingman confirms:
   ```
   ✓ Position opened: QQQ long 100 @ $601.25
   Stop: $600.00 | Target: $604.00
   Risk: $125 | Reward: $275 | R:R: 1:2.2
   Account: $23,105.83 → Now invested in QQQ
   ```

---

### 2. Monitoring the Position

**You ask:**
```
"Show positions"
```

**Wingman displays:**
```
OPEN POSITIONS (1):
├─ QQQ long 100 @ $601.25
│  ├─ Current Price: $601.25 (no change yet)
│  ├─ Unrealized P/L: $0 (0%)
│  ├─ Stop: $600.00 | Target: $604.00
│  └─ Entry Time: 14:30 (just now)
```

**If price moves to $603:**

**You say:**
```
"QQQ at $603 now"
```

**Wingman updates:**
1. Calls `update_position_price("QQQ", 603.00)`
2. Calculates unrealized P&L:
   - P&L = ($603 - $601.25) × 100 = $175
   - P&L % = ($175 / $60,125) × 100 = 0.29%
3. Saves to positions.json
4. Displays:
   ```
   QQQ POSITION UPDATE:
   Current Price: $603.00
   Unrealized P/L: +$175.00 (+0.29%)
   ```

---

### 3. Closing a Trade

**You say:**
```
"Closed QQQ at $603.50"
```

**What happens:**
1. Wingman parses exit price
2. State manager calls `close_position("QQQ", 603.50)`
3. Realized P&L calculated:
   - P&L = ($603.50 - $601.25) × 100 = $225
   - P&L % = ($225 / $60,125) × 100 = 0.37%
4. Position moved from `open_positions` to `closed_positions` in positions.json:
   ```json
   {
     "ticker": "QQQ",
     "direction": "long",
     "shares": 100,
     "entry_price": 601.25,
     "exit_price": 603.50,
     "realized_pnl": 225.00,
     "hold_duration": "15m",
     "exit_time": "2025-10-27T14:45:00Z"
   }
   ```
5. Cash is returned + profit:
   - Capital returned: $60,125
   - P&L added: $225
   - New cash: Previous cash + $60,350
6. Account balance updated:
   - Total balance: $23,105.83 + $225 = $23,330.83
   - YTD P/L: $3,152.57 + $225 = $3,377.57

7. Wingman confirms:
   ```
   ✓ Position closed: QQQ
   Entry: $601.25 | Exit: $603.50
   Realized P/L: +$225.00 (+0.37%)
   Hold Duration: 15 minutes
   Account Updated: $23,330.83
   ```

---

### 4. Account Status Display

**You say:**
```
"Show account"
```

**Command Center displays (from account_state.json):**
```
ACCOUNT STATUS
├─ Total Balance: $23,330.83
├─ Available Cash: $23,330.83 (100%)
├─ YTD P/L: +$3,377.57
├─ Open Positions: 0
├─ Today's Trades: 1
├─ Today's P&L: +$225.00
└─ Daily Win Rate: 100% (1 win, 0 losses)
```

---

### 5. End of Day Wrap

**You say at end of day:**
```
"Wingman, eod wrap
Good discipline today - tight stops, quick exits. Ready for tomorrow."
```

**EOD Wrap automation runs 7 steps:**

**Step 1: Collect Session Data**
- Reads positions.json
- Finds all positions where `exit_time` matches today's date
- Found: 1 trade (QQQ closed at $603.50)

**Step 2: Generate Journal Entry**
- Creates: `Journal/Log-Entries/2025-10-27_EOD_Wrap.md`
- Contents:
  ```markdown
  # 2025-10-27 EOD Wrap
  ## Session Summary
  **Trades:** 1
  **P/L:** +$225.00
  **Win Rate:** 100%

  ## Trades Executed
  ### QQQ Long
  - Entry: 14:30 @ $601.25 (100 shares)
  - Exit: 14:45 @ $603.50
  - P/L: +$225.00 (+0.37%)
  - Duration: 15m

  ## Notes
  Good discipline today - tight stops, quick exits. Ready for tomorrow.
  ```

**Step 3: Update Command Center**
- Updates the "Recent Closed Trades" section with today's trades

**Step 4: Update Account State**
- Finalizes daily P&L calculation
- Updates YTD balance
- Saves to account_state.json

**Step 5: Finalize Session Summary**
- Compiles performance metrics
- Archives to monthly folder if needed

**Step 6: Update Journal.md Index**
- Adds entry to Journal/Journal.md index
- Makes it searchable and organized

**Step 7: Reset Session State**
- Prepares system for next session
- Keeps all data intact

## System Constraints

**Enforced Automatically:**

| Constraint | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Max Equity % | 70% | Prevent overleveraging |
| Min Cash % | 10% | Emergency liquidity |
| Max Crypto % | 30% | Concentration risk |
| Max Single Position % | 50% | Concentration risk |

When you try to open a position that violates these, Wingman blocks it:
```
❌ Insufficient cash: Need $50,000, Have $13,630.83
```

## Testing the System

### Quick Verification

**Test 1: Start State**
```
Run: wingman, status
Verify: Shows current balance, cash, open positions
Expected:
  Account: $23,105.83
  Cash: $23,105.83
  Open: 0 positions
  YTD: +$3,152.57
```

**Test 2: Open Trade**
```
Say: "Opened TEST long 100 @ $50"
Verify:
  - positions.json has new open_position
  - account_state.json cash reduced
  - Wingman confirms entry
```

**Test 3: Close Trade**
```
Say: "Closed TEST at $51"
Verify:
  - positions.json moved to closed_positions
  - Realized P&L calculated (+$100)
  - account_state.json cash updated
  - Wingman confirms P&L
```

**Test 4: EOD Wrap**
```
Say: "Wingman, eod wrap - great day"
Verify:
  - Journal entry created (Log-Entries/2025-10-27_EOD_Wrap.md)
  - Command Center updated with stats
  - Journal.md index updated
  - No errors in wrap report
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Quick Scalp
```
14:35 - Opened SPY long 100 @ $585.25, stop 584.75, target 586
14:38 - SPY at $586.10 now
14:39 - Closed SPY at $586.10
Result: +$85 (50 seconds, 0.14% gain)
```

### Scenario 2: Failed Trade (Stop Hit)
```
10:00 - Opened QQQ long 50 @ $600, stop 598, target 605
10:15 - QQQ at $598.50 - breach detected
10:16 - Closed QQQ at $598 (stop hit)
Result: -$100 (16 minutes, -0.33% loss)
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-leg Day
```
09:30 - NVDA long 50 @ $189 → Exit 12:00 @ $191 → +$100
11:45 - TSLA short 30 @ $250 → Exit 14:30 @ $248 → +$60
15:00 - QQQ long 100 @ $600 → Exit 15:45 @ $601 → +$100
EOD: 3 trades, +$260 daily P&L
YTD: $3,152.57 + $260 = $3,412.57
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient cash" error
**Cause:** Position size exceeds available cash
**Solution:** Reduce shares or close existing positions
```
Have: $23,105.83
Need: $50,000 (100 × $500)
Fix: Use 46 shares instead (100 × $500 = $23,000)
```

### Issue: Position not showing
**Cause:** Position might not have been saved
**Solution:**
```
Say: "Show positions"
If empty, data wasn't persisted. Restart and try again.
```

### Issue: P&L doesn't match
**Cause:** Rounding or price update not saved
**Solution:**
```
Update price: "TSLA at $251.50"
Wait for system to recalculate
Then close: "Closed TSLA at $251.50"
```
