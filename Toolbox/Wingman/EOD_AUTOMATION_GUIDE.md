## üìã The 7-Step EOD Wrap Process

When you call "wingman, eod wrap", the system executes this complete sequence:

### **Step 1: Collect Session Data**
Wingman reads all your closed positions from today and calculates:
- Total trades executed
- Realized P&L from all trades
- Win/loss count
- Daily performance metrics

### **Step 2: Generate Journal Entry**
Creates `Journal/Log-Entries/2025-10-27_EOD_Wrap.md` with:
- Trade-by-trade breakdown (entry, exit, P&L, duration)
- Account summary (balance, YTD P/L)
- Your execution review (notes you provided)
- Next session preparation section

### **Step 3: Update Command Center**
Refreshes `Journal/COMMAND_CENTER.md`:
- Account balance (latest)
- YTD P/L (cumulative)
- Today's trade count & results
- Last updated timestamp

### **Step 4: Update Account State**
Persists to `Journal/account_state.json`:
- New account balance (after today's P&L)
- Updated YTD P/L
- Data freshness mark
- Last updated date

### **Step 5: Finalize Session Summary**
Updates `Research/AI/2025-10-27_SESSION_SUMMARY.md`:
- Trades executed list
- Session statistics table
- EOD finalization timestamp

### **Step 6: Update Journal Index**
Adds today's entry to `Journal/Journal.md`:
- Newest entry at top (newest-first format)
- One-line summary with key metrics
- Link to detailed entry

### **Step 7: Reset Session State**
Prepares `.session_state.json` for next session:
- Clears open/closed position arrays
- Keeps all your rules and settings
- Preserves account balance
- Sets status to READY
