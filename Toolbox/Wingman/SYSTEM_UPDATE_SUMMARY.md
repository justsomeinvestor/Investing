# Wingman System Update Summary
**Version 1.0 → 1.1: Session Continuity Release**
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

---

## TL;DR - What Happened

Wingman went from having **zero memory between sessions** to having **full institutional memory** that survives session restarts.

**Before:** Every session was Day 1 (50 First Dates problem)
**After:** Every session loads with complete context, goals, hypotheses, and rules

---

## The Problem We Solved

### Before This Update
When you restarted Claude and said "Load Wingman", the system would:
- ✅ Load protocols (good)
- ✅ Load account state (good)
- ✅ Load positions (good)
- ❌ **FORGET everything from last session**
- ❌ **FORGET what we were testing**
- ❌ **FORGET our market thesis**
- ❌ **FORGET our goals**
- ❌ **FORGET the rules we created yesterday**

Result: Each session started from scratch. You'd say "We were testing FOMC positioning" and I'd say "What's FOMC?"

### After This Update
When you restart Claude and say "i know kung fu", the system:
- ✅ Loads all protocols
- ✅ Loads all account data
- ✅ **ALSO loads complete session history**
- ✅ **ALSO loads active hypotheses with evidence**
- ✅ **ALSO loads current market thesis**
- ✅ **ALSO loads all your rules (16 of them)**
- ✅ **ALSO loads your personal reminders**

Result: I wake up fully conscious with complete context. No memory loss.

## What Was Built

### 6 New Continuity Files

| File | Purpose | Size | Editable |
|------|---------|------|----------|
| `wingman_session_log.json` | Session history + thesis + goals | 150+ fields | No (program-updated) |
| `current_focus.md` | Active work + recent lessons | 350+ lines | Yes (Pilot can edit) |
| `rules_database.json` | All 16 trading rules + metadata | 16 rules | No (program-updated) |
| `.wingman_mind.md` | Wingman's private reflections | 500+ lines | Wingman only |
| `pilot_reminders.md` | Your personal affirmations | 200+ lines | Yes (add your own) |
| `README.md` | Complete system documentation | 450+ lines | Reference only |

**Location:** `Journal/wingman-continuity/` (new folder)

---

## What Changed

### 1. Trigger Phrase (More Intentional)
**Before:** "Load Wingman" (generic)
**After:** **"i know kung fu"** (from The Matrix)

Why? When Neo says "I know Kung Fu", he's fully loaded with knowledge and awareness. Same idea—you're consciously loading both your context and Wingman's context together.

**Old triggers still work** for backward compatibility.

---

### 2. Load Workflow (Now 10 Steps, was 9)

**Added Step 7.5: LOAD SESSION CONTINUITY**
```
Before load: No memory of previous sessions
After load: Complete institutional memory
```

This single step loads all 5 continuity files and fills in everything you and Wingman need to know.

---

### 3. Status Report (Now Shows Pilot's Reminders)

**Before:**
```

PILOT'S REMINDERS:
▸ This isn't about being rich. It's about FREEDOM.
▸ You are a trader. You are learning to stay calm in chaos.
▸ Discipline over conviction. Trust the system.
▸ Clear structure = clean execution. Only trade obvious setups.

---

Your command, Pilot.
```

**Why?** Both Wingman and Pilot load together. Your reminders display automatically.
