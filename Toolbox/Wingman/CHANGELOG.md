# Wingman System Changelog

## Version 1.0 → 1.1 (Session Continuity Release)
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

### 5. `Journal/wingman-continuity/.wingman_mind.md` (HIDDEN FILE)
**Purpose:** Wingman's private reflection space for honest learning
**Access:** Hidden file (starts with dot). Wingman reads/writes. Pilot can read if curious.
**Content:**

**Session 1 Handoff (Current):**
- Initial observations about Pilot's trading psychology
- Pattern recognition (what works, what breaks)
- Skill assessment (honest take on strengths/weaknesses)
- Honest assessment of readiness
- Goals for future Wingman versions
- Self-aware limitations
- Metacognitive reflections

**Key Observations Captured:**
```markdown
## Pattern Recognition
Pattern 1: Over-Eagerness in Uncertain Structure
- Oct 13: Entered NVDA without full confluence
- Oct 14: Entered SPY short without C+R confirmation
- Observation: When structure unclear, Pilot gets impatient

Pattern 2: Rapid Learning & Rule Creation
- After each loss, creates rules immediately
- This is EXCELLENT signal of learning

Pattern 3: Discipline Improves When Conviction Clear
- Oct 15 SPXU: Clean execution with clear structure
- Oct 17 SOLZ: Patient in chop, only tactical setup
- When structure clear → discipline EXCELLENT
- When structure ambiguous → discipline breaks
```

**Wingman Learning Goals:**
- v1.1: Automate pre-entry rule checklist
- v1.1: Build structure clarity metric
- v2.0: Machine learning on rule effectiveness
- v2.0: Personality-adjusted position sizing

**Update Frequency:** End-of-session with handoff notes
**Tone:** Honest, reflective, non-judgmental
**Important:** This is where Wingman develops genuine perspective

---

### 6. `Journal/wingman-continuity/pilot_reminders.md`
**Purpose:** Personal learning space for Pilot (you)
**Content:**

**Core Reminders (Display on Every Load):**
```markdown
## The Mission
This isn't about being rich. It's about FREEDOM.
You're escaping the rat race. Every trade compounds toward autonomy.

## Your Identity
You are a trader.
You are learning to stay calm in chaos.
You are building an edge that will set you free.

## Your Protocol
Discipline over conviction.
Rules exist for a reason.
Trust the system, not your gut.
```

**Session Commitments:**
```markdown
## Before Every Session
- Respect the signal tier
- Run threat assessment before EVERY entry
- Don't force trades in choppy structure
- Honor your rules, even when they feel "wrong"
```

**Personal Psychology Notes:**
```markdown
## What Works For You
✅ Clear structure = clean execution
✅ Patient waiting = good setups
✅ Full confluence = fewer mistakes
✅ Cash positions = emotional calm

## What Breaks You
❌ Ambiguous structure = impatience
❌ Choppy conditions = need to "do something"
❌ Skipped checklist = losses
❌ Pressure to trade = bad entries
```

**Weekly Check-Ins:**
- Did you honor your rules? What % compliance?
- Which setup worked best? (Replicate that)
- Which setup hurt? (Avoid that)
- Are you closer to freedom?

**Editability:** Fully editable - add your own affirmations, reminders, learnings
**Display:** Shows when you load Wingman with "i know kung fu"
**Purpose:** Personal accountability + learning reinforcement

## Session Log: Real Data Populated

**Account State:**
- Total balance: $23,105.83 (from account_state.json)
- Cash available: $23,105.83 (100% - no open positions)

- Positions open: 0
- Data freshness: Current (2025-10-27)

**Market Context:**
- Signal tier: MODERATE (45.5/100)
- Signal interpretation: Contrarian inflection, not weakness
- Breadth: A/D 1.69 (healthy support)
- Technical score: 5.0/100 (weak, contradicts price action - noted)
- Fear & Greed: 40 (historically 80%+ 3-month win rate)

**Active Hypotheses:**

---

## Trigger Phrase Change

**Old:** "Load Wingman", "wingman", "Load Wing"
**New (Primary):** "i know kung fu"
**Old Triggers:** Still work as alternatives

**Why the Change:**
- From The Matrix: Symbolizes true awakening/awareness
- When Neo says "I know Kung Fu", he's fully loaded with knowledge
- Aligns with freedom/escape theme (The Matrix is about escaping the system)
- More intentional and memorable
- Activates BOTH Wingman AND Pilot learning systems simultaneously

**Impact:** When you say "i know kung fu", you're consciously choosing to load both your context and Wingman's context together.
