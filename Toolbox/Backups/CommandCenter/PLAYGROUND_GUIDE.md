## Playground Principles

### 1. **Iterative Improvement**
- Small changes → Test → Verify → Integrate
- Not big bang rewrites
- Each change moves you forward

### 2. **Keep Documentation Updated**
- Code changes = doc updates
- New features = new documentation
- Breaking changes = update guides

### 3. **Test Before Deploying**
- Changes must work with Wingman
- Commands must function
- Integrations must sync
- No breaking changes

### 4. **Backwards Compatibility**
- Old commands still work
- Data formats preserved
- Don't break existing workflows
- Additive changes preferred

### 5. **Version Control**
- Track major changes
- Create changelog entries
- Note what/why/when
- Enable rollback if needed

## Safety Nets

### If Something Breaks:
1. **Restore from backup:**
   ```bash
   cp Toolbox/Backups/CommandCenter/COMMAND_CENTER.md.bak Journal/COMMAND_CENTER.md
   ```

2. **Check what changed:**
   - Compare against backup
   - Use git diff if available
   - Review recent edits

3. **Revert and try again:**
   - Restore original
   - Make smaller changes
   - Test more carefully

### Always Remember:
🔒 **Your backups are safe**
🔒 **You can always restore**
🔒 **Experiment freely**
🔒 **Changes are reversible**
