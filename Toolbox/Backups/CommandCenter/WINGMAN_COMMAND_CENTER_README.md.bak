## 📈 Understanding Your Results

### Green Signal (BUY) 🟢
```
What to do:
  ✓ Enter at the suggested Entry price
  ✓ Place Stop order immediately below Entry
  ✓ Set Target order at suggested level
  ✓ Monitor trade as it develops

Example (SPY):
  • Enter: $585.50
  • Stop: $583.25 (risk $2.25 per share)
  • Target: $591.75 (reward $6.25 per share)
  • Ratio: 1:2.8 (great!)
```

### Yellow Signal (WAIT) 🟡
```
What to do:
  ✓ Don't enter yet - too uncertain
  ✓ Watch the key levels
  ✓ Wait for clearer direction
  ✓ If breaks up → becomes BUY
  ✓ If breaks down → becomes AVOID

Why wait?
  • Too many conflicting signals
  • Risk/reward not attractive
  • Better opportunities elsewhere
```

### Red Signal (AVOID) 🔴
```
What to do:
  ✓ Skip this trade entirely
  ✓ Look for other opportunities
  ✓ Come back later if conditions change

Why avoid?
  • Signal probability too low (<45%)
  • Risk/reward unfavorable
  • Market going wrong direction
  • Better setups available
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Quick Comparison
PIN the first analysis, then analyze another one. See both at once!

### Tip 2: Consistent Entry
Always use the suggested Entry price, not just "close enough"

### Tip 3: Protect Your Stop
ALWAYS place the Stop order immediately after entering. Don't wait.

### Tip 4: Trust the R:R
If R:R is < 1:1, skip the trade. Risk/reward must favor you.

### Tip 5: Read the Reasoning
The reasoning explains WHY the signal is what it is. Understand it.

### Tip 6: Watch the Components
If TA is high but Sentiment is low, there's a conflict. Be cautious.

### Tip 7: Multiple Timeframes
A BUY on 5-min might be a WAIT on daily. Check context.

### Tip 8: Keep Analyzing
More analysis = more confidence. Run the decision engine regularly.
