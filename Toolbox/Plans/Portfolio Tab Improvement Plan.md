Portfolio Tab Improvement Plan
Overview
Enhance the Portfolio tab with visual deltas, health scoring, execution helpers, and confidence indicators to make it a truly powerful AI fund manager interface.
Proposed Improvements
1. Visual Delta Indicators ‚≠ê HIGH IMPACT
What: Show exact changes between current and target allocations with arrows and color coding
Add percentage point delta badges (e.g., "+10%" or "-5%") next to each allocation
Use directional arrows (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí) to show direction of change
Color code: Green for increases, Red for decreases, Gray for no change
Calculate dollar amounts for each delta
Why: Makes it instantly clear what needs to change without mental math
2. Allocation Health Score ‚≠ê HIGH IMPACT
What: Single 0-100 metric showing how well current allocation aligns with signal
Visual gauge/progress bar showing alignment score
Formula: Based on distance from optimal allocation for current signal tier
Color-coded zones: Red (<40), Yellow (40-60), Green (60-80), Blue (80-100)
Warning if misalignment is severe (score <40)
Why: One number to show portfolio positioning quality at a glance
3. Execution Helper ‚≠ê HIGH IMPACT
What: Calculate exact trades needed with current market prices
Fetch current prices for SPLG, BTC from latest data
Calculate exact shares/units to buy or sell
Show estimated transaction costs (0.1% assumption)
"Copy to Clipboard" button for quick execution
Format: Ready-to-paste trade list
Why: Removes friction between recommendation and execution
4. Confidence Indicators ‚≠ê MEDIUM IMPACT
What: Show AI confidence level for each recommendation
Overall confidence score (Low/Medium/High) based on:
Signal strength (how far from tier boundaries)
Data freshness (all sources updated today?)
Consensus level (X sentiment vs technicals alignment)
Per-action confidence tags
"High conviction" vs "low conviction" visual badges
Why: Helps prioritize which recommendations to follow first
5. Historical Context üîµ NICE TO HAVE
What: Show previous recommendation and whether you followed it
Previous date and allocation
"You followed: Yes/No/Partial"
Simple 7-day allocation history sparkline
Track: Did following the AI help?
Why: Builds trust and accountability over time
6. Enhanced Risk Display üîµ NICE TO HAVE
What: Show portfolio risk metrics (current vs target)
Expected volatility comparison
Beta to SPX/BTC
Max drawdown estimate
Downside protection score
Why: Quantifies risk reduction/increase from recommended changes

Example Enhanced Output
üíº Portfolio Health: 45/100 (Misaligned) ‚ö†Ô∏è

Current ‚Üí Target Allocation:
Cash:     50% ‚Üí 60% [+10% ‚Üë +$5,000]
Equities: 30% ‚Üí 25% [-5% ‚Üì -$2,500]
Crypto:   20% ‚Üí 10% [-10% ‚Üì -$5,000]
Hedges:    0% ‚Üí  5% [+5% ‚Üë +$2,500]

üìã Exact Trades (High Confidence):
‚Üí Sell 52 shares SPLG @ $48.12 = $2,502
‚Üí Sell 0.0427 BTC @ $116,800 = $4,987
‚Üí Buy 125 VIX calls @ $20.00 = $2,500
