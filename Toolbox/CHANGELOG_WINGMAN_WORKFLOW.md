# Wingman Workflow Changes & Enhancements

## Latest Update: October 25, 2025 - Bug Fix Release

### CRITICAL BUG FIX: YAML Indentation Error in sync_risk_items.py & sync_provider_consensus.py

**Issue:** Both new sync scripts were generating invalid YAML with unquoted strings containing special characters (colons, quotes, etc.), causing dashboard load failure with "bad indentation of a mapping entry" error.

**Root Cause:** Manual YAML string building without proper quoting. When descriptions contained ":" characters (e.g., "Risk: Stagflation scenario"), the YAML parser failed.

**Fix Applied (October 25, 2025):**
- ✅ Added `import yaml` to both scripts
- ✅ Replaced manual string concatenation with `yaml.dump()` for proper serialization
- ✅ Now automatically quotes strings with special characters
- ✅ Handles Unicode and line wrapping correctly

**Files Fixed:**
1. `scripts/utilities/sync_risk_items.py` (lines 27, 148-176)
2. `scripts/utilities/sync_provider_consensus.py` (lines 27, 159-195)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Both scripts execute without errors
- ✅ YAML output is valid and properly formatted
- ✅ master-plan.md parses correctly
- ✅ Dashboard loads without indentation errors

**Prevention:** By using `yaml.dump()` instead of manual string building, this error class is now eliminated permanently. Future modifications to these scripts will inherit the safe YAML generation pattern.

### NEW SCRIPTS ADDED TO WINGMAN DASH PHASE 2

**Two new sync scripts have been integrated into the `wingman dash` workflow:**

#### 1. `scripts/utilities/sync_risk_items.py` ✅
- **Purpose:** Automatically generate `dashboard.riskItems` from Market Sentiment Overview
- **Data Source:** `Research/.cache/YYYY-MM-DD_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md` (Risk Factors section)
- **Output:** Fresh risk items with detailed descriptions in YAML format
- **Timestamp:** `dashboard.riskItemsUpdated`
- **First Executed:** October 25, 2025
- **Status:** Production Ready ✅

#### 2. `scripts/utilities/sync_provider_consensus.py` ✅
- **Purpose:** Automatically generate `dashboard.providerConsensus` from Market Sentiment Overview
- **Data Source:** `Research/.cache/YYYY-MM-DD_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md` (Cross-Provider Consensus Themes section)
- **Output:** Consensus themes with sentiment classification in YAML format
- **Timestamp:** `dashboard.providerConsensusUpdated` + `providerConsensus.updatedAt`
- **First Executed:** October 25, 2025
- **Status:** Production Ready ✅

---

## Integration Details

### Modified Files:
1. **`scripts/automation/wingman_dash.py`** (lines 80-81)
   - Added both new scripts to `sync_scripts` list in Phase 2
   - Both scripts now execute as part of standard workflow

2. **`Toolbox/INSTRUCTIONS/Domains/Wingman_Command_Pipeline.txt`** (Phase 2 section)
   - Updated documentation to include new scripts
   - Added NOTE explaining automatic data extraction

---

## How These Scripts Work

### Data Flow:
```
wingman prep
    ↓ creates
Research/.cache/YYYY-MM-DD_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md
    ↓ contains
  Risk Factors (Tier 1-3)
  Cross-Provider Consensus Themes (7 themes)
    ↓ extracted by
sync_risk_items.py ↘
                    → wingman dash (Phase 2)
sync_provider_consensus.py ↗
    ↓ populates
dashboard.riskItems
dashboard.providerConsensus
```

### What Changed:
**BEFORE:** Risk items and provider consensus only received timestamp updates (stale content)
**AFTER:** Both sections now receive FRESH CONTENT from research files during Phase 2

---

## Testing & Verification

### Scripts Tested: October 25, 2025 ✅
```
[RUNNING] risk_items_sync...
   ✅ risk_items_sync completed

[RUNNING] provider_consensus_sync...
   ✅ provider_consensus_sync completed
```

### Output Verified: October 25, 2025 ✅
- ✅ 4 risk items extracted with detailed descriptions
- ✅ 3-4 consensus themes extracted with sentiment classification
- ✅ All YAML formatting correct
- ✅ Timestamps properly updated
- ✅ master-plan.md structure valid

## Next Run Instructions (October 26+)

When you run `wingman dash` next time, the workflow will automatically:

### Phase 2 Execution Order:
1. sync_social_tab.py
2. sync_technicals_tab.py
3. sync_news_tab.py
4. sync_daily_planner.py
5. update_markets_intelligence.py
6. sync_quick_actions.py
7. **sync_risk_items.py** ← NEW (extracts from research)
8. **sync_provider_consensus.py** ← NEW (extracts from research)

**Action Required:** NONE - Both scripts execute automatically as part of wingman dash

---

## Technical Details

### sync_risk_items.py
- **Extracts:** Tier 1 risk factors (highest probability risks)
- **Format:** YAML with title + description fields
- **Count:** Top 4 risks
- **Update Method:** Regex-based content replacement + timestamp update

### sync_provider_consensus.py
- **Extracts:** Cross-provider consensus themes ranked by consensus %
- **Format:** YAML with theme + description + sentiment fields
- **Count:** Top 3-4 themes
- **Sentiment Mapping:** BULLISH, BEARISH, NEUTRAL, MIXED, CAUTIOUSLY_BULLISH, CAUTIOUSLY_BEARISH
- **Update Method:** Regex-based content extraction + YAML generation + timestamp update

## Verification Checklist for Future Runs

When running `wingman dash`, verify:

- [ ] Both scripts in `wingman_dash.py` sync_scripts list (lines 80-81)
- [ ] Market Sentiment Overview file exists: `Research/.cache/YYYY-MM-DD_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md`
- [ ] Risk items updated in master-plan.md with current date content
- [ ] Provider consensus updated in master-plan.md with current date content
- [ ] Timestamps updated: `riskItemsUpdated` and `providerConsensusUpdated`
- [ ] wingman_dash logs show both scripts completed: `✅ risk_items_sync completed`, `✅ provider_consensus_sync completed`

---

## Questions/Issues

If either script fails during future runs:

1. **Verify data source exists:** `Research/.cache/YYYY-MM-DD_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md`
2. **Check script paths:** Both in `scripts/utilities/`
3. **Check wingman_dash.py integration:** Lines 80-81 should reference both scripts
4. **Check YAML format:** master-plan.md should have proper indentation and structure
