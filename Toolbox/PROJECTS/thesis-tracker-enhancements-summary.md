## What's Been Built

### New Dashboard Widgets (6 Total)

Replaced the basic 3-widget dashboard with **6 sophisticated, data-rich visualizations** that tell a complete story about your portfolio:

#### **1. Score Composition** (Stacked Horizontal Bar)
- **What it shows**: Breakdown of what makes each score
- **Visual**: Top 8 tickers by conviction score, broken into 5 dimensions:
  - Fundamentals (Indigo)
  - Technicals (Purple)
  - Management (Green)
  - Risk (Yellow)
  - Sentiment (Blue)
- **Why it matters**: See instantly if NVDA's 85 comes from fundamentals (strong) or just hype (sentiment). Each segment shows percentage.
- **Data**: Each bar is 100%, divided among 5 pillars

#### **2. Risk vs Conviction** (Scatter Plot)
- **What it shows**: Portfolio positioning in 2D space
- **Visual**: Interactive scatter plot with:
  - X-axis: Conviction Score (0-100)
  - Y-axis: Risk Level (0-10)
  - Color-coded by conviction: Green (high), Yellow (medium), Red (speculative)
  - Hover shows exact scores + ticker name
- **Quadrants**:
  - Top-right (best): High conviction, low risk ✅
  - Top-left (emerging): Speculative, low risk 🟡
  - Bottom-right (careful): High conviction, risky ⚠️
  - Bottom-left (avoid): Speculative, risky 🔴
- **Why it matters**: Identify portfolio concentration and position sizing guidance

#### **3. Conviction Distribution** (SVG Gauges)
- **What it shows**: Portfolio strength snapshot
- **Visual**: 3 circular gauge charts showing:
  - High Conviction (>75): Count + percentage ✅
  - Medium Conviction (50-75): Count + percentage 🟡
  - Speculative (<50): Count + percentage 🔴
- **Bottom stat**: Portfolio Strength Score (weighted average: 0-100%)
- **Why it matters**: One-glance answer to "How confident am I in my watchlist?"

#### **4. Theme Exposure** (Horizontal Bar Chart)
- **What it shows**: Portfolio diversification by theme
- **Visual**: Themes on Y-axis, count on X-axis
- **Themes identified**:
  - AI & ML
  - Healthcare
  - Consumer
  - Energy
  - Finance
  - Semiconductors
  - Cloud & Infrastructure
  - Automotive
  - Other
- **Color-coded**: By average conviction in that theme
- **Why it matters**: Spot concentration risk ("Am I too heavy in AI?")

#### **5. Action Items** (Status Dashboard)
- **What it shows**: Data hygiene + operational priorities
- **Visual**: Color-coded list with icons:
  - 🔴 **Outdated** (>60 days): Most urgent - thesis needs updating
  - ⚠️ **Stale** (30-60 days): Aging - should refresh soon
  - ✅ **Upcoming** (catalysts): Watch these events - could trigger moves
- **Why it matters**: Prevents decision-making on stale data. Reminds you of catalyst dates.

#### **6. Portfolio Statistics** (Metrics Grid)
- **What it shows**: Quick portfolio aggregates
- **Metrics displayed**:
  - Average Score (overall conviction)
  - Average Fundamentals (foundation strength)
  - Average Technicals (momentum)
  - Average Risk (exposure)
  - Highest Score & Ticker
  - Lowest Score & Ticker
- **Why it matters**: Quick reference for overall portfolio health
