## Test Scenario: SPY Short at Extension

### Initial State (Before Analysis)
**User opens:** `Journal/trade-console.html`
**Console displays:**
- Signal Light: üî¥ RED (NO GO)
- Progress: 0/15 conditions (0%)
- All conditions: ‚è≥ NOT_CHECKED

**Live Assessment JSON state:**
```json
{
  "status": "AWAITING_TICKER",
  "ticker": null,
  "signal_light": "RED",
  "setup_type": null,
  "overall_progress": { "items_passed": 0, "items_total": 0, "items_required": 15, "percentage": 0 }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Analysis Flow

### Message 1: User mentions the ticker and direction
**User:** "What about shorting SPY? Price just broke below $595."

**Wingman:**
- Detects: SPY short = EXTENSION_SELL setup
- Opens assessment session

  ```json
  {
    "ticker": "SPY",
    "setup_type": "EXTENSION_SELL",
    "signal_light": "RED",
    "overall_progress": { "items_required": 15 }
  }
  ```

**Console updates:**
