# Markets Intelligence Integration Summary

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Testing Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

Markets Intelligence tab now has **automated AI narrative generation** integrated into the Wingman Dash workflow. Rich, synthesized market analysis is generated daily using Claude Code (embedded AI) instead of external API calls. The system uses a **semi-automated approach** where the workflow prompts Claude Code to synthesize narratives, ensuring high-quality human-level analysis without API dependencies.

**Key Achievement**: Markets Intelligence AI narratives now match Daily Planner visual style and are updated automatically as part of Phase 5 (Claude Code AI Synthesis) of the wingman dash workflow.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Workflow Integration

**File**: `scripts/automation/wingman_dash.py`

**Changes**:
- Added `update_markets_intelligence.py` to Phase 2 sync scripts (line 78)
- Created dedicated Markets Intelligence AI prompt in Phase 5 (lines 396-435)
- Updated completion report to include Markets Intelligence 6-field requirements (lines 512-531)
- Added 600 character limit guidelines to writing guidelines (lines 427-431)

**Flow**:
```
Phase 1: Timestamp verification (detects stale Markets Intelligence)
    ↓
Phase 2: update_markets_intelligence.py runs
    → Gathers market data (signals, prices, Fear & Greed)
    → Extracts provider insights
    → Generates AI prompt (saved to Research/.cache/)
    ↓
Phase 3: Update master plan (dates, signals)
    ↓
Phase 4: Final verification
    ↓
Phase 5: CLAUDE CODE SYNTHESIS
    → Workflow outputs detailed instructions
    → Claude Code reads research files
    → Claude Code synthesizes 6 fields
    → Claude Code updates master-plan.md + timestamp
```

### 2. Data Structure

**File**: `master-plan/master-plan.md`

**Markets Intelligence aiInterpretation Fields**:
```yaml
tabs:
  - id: markets
    label: 📊 Markets Intelligence
    aiInterpretation:
      summary: "Concise market context (≤600 chars)"
      keyInsight: "Critical insight (≤600 chars)"
      action: "Actionable guidance (≤600 chars)"
      sentiment: "cautiously bullish | neutral | cautiously bearish"
      confidence: "low | medium | medium-high | high"
      updatedAt: "2025-10-23T13:45:54Z"
```

**Character Limits**: All text fields capped at ≤600 characters for dashboard scannability.

**Current Values** (as of 2025-10-23):
- summary: 389 chars
- keyInsight: 234 chars
- action: 305 chars
- sentiment: cautiously bullish
- confidence: medium-high

### 3. Visual Display

The Markets Intelligence tab now displays exactly like the Daily Planner:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ AI NARRATIVE BRIEFING                                   │
│ Status ● CAUTIOUSLY BULLISH | Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH   │

## How It Works (Complete Flow)

### User Initiates Workflow
```bash
python scripts/automation/wingman_dash.py 2025-10-23
```

### Automated Phase (1-4)
1. **Timestamp verification** → Detects if Markets Intelligence is stale
2. **Sync scripts run** → `update_markets_intelligence.py` gathers data + generates AI prompt file
3. **Master plan update** → Updates dates, signals, other automated data
4. **Final verification** → Confirms data freshness

### Manual Phase (5 - Claude Code)
1. **Workflow outputs** →
   ```
   Markets Intelligence tab needs SIX fields updated:
   1. tabs.markets.aiInterpretation.summary (≤600 chars)
   2. tabs.markets.aiInterpretation.keyInsight (≤600 chars)
   3. tabs.markets.aiInterpretation.action (≤600 chars)
   4. tabs.markets.aiInterpretation.sentiment
   5. tabs.markets.aiInterpretation.confidence
   6. tabs.markets.aiInterpretation.updatedAt

   Research Sources:
   • Research/.cache/2025-10-23_Market_Sentiment_Overview.md
   • Research/2025-10-23_Technical_Category_Overview.md
   ```

2. **Claude Code reads** → Opens research files and reviews current market data

3. **Claude Code synthesizes** →
   - Extracts market structure context
   - Identifies technical inflection points
   - Recognizes structural themes
   - Creates actionable guidance
   - Selects sentiment/confidence levels

4. **Claude Code updates** →
   - Updates all 6 fields in master-plan.md
   - Sets `updatedAt` to current ISO 8601 timestamp
   - Saves file

5. **Result** → Markets Intelligence display shows fresh rich narratives with current date

---

## Character Limit Rationale

**Why ≤600 characters?**

1. **Dashboard Scannability** - Three sections (Summary Pulse, Key Insight, Actionable Focus) must fit cleanly in UI
2. **Readability** - Forces concise, focused messaging (tweet-length)
3. **Consistency** - Matches Daily Planner field lengths
4. **Quality** - Eliminates unnecessary verbiage, focuses on critical insights
5. **Mobile-Friendly** - Works well on smaller screens

**Validation**: Always count characters before submitting:
```
- summary: MUST be ≤600 chars (currently 389)
- keyInsight: MUST be ≤600 chars (currently 234)
- action: MUST be ≤600 chars (currently 305)
```

---

## Comparison: Daily Planner vs Markets Intelligence

Both tabs now follow the same AI narrative structure:

| Field | Daily Planner | Markets Intelligence | Character Limit |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| summary | Trading context | Market context | ≤600 |
| keyInsight | Critical insight | Critical insight | ≤600 |
| action | Trading posture | Actionable guidance | ≤600 |
| sentiment | cautiously bullish | cautiously bullish | N/A (dropdown) |
| confidence | medium-high | medium-high | N/A (dropdown) |
| updatedAt | Current timestamp | Current timestamp | ISO 8601 |

**Visual Result**: Identical layout with three clearly separated, scannable sections.

## Key Concepts

### Semi-Automated Approach
- **Why not fully automated?** Because rich AI narratives require understanding context
- **Current solution**: Workflow prompts Claude Code (you) → you synthesize → dashboard displays
- **Same effect as API**: Rich AI content is generated, just using Claude Code instead of external API
- **Benefit**: No API costs, no rate limits, control over quality

### 600 Character Limit
- Ensures scannability and readability
- Matches Daily Planner styling
- Forces concise, high-quality messaging
- Works well on all screen sizes

### Six Fields
1. **summary** - Market context (technical + themes)
2. **keyInsight** - The ONE critical insight
3. **action** - What to do + conditional logic
4. **sentiment** - Overall market sentiment
5. **confidence** - Confidence in assessment
6. **updatedAt** - Timestamp for freshness verification

---

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is this semi-automated instead of fully automated?**
A: Because rich AI narratives require nuanced understanding of context. The workflow prompts Claude Code to synthesize - same end result as an API call, but with embedded AI instead of external service.

**Q: What if I forget to update Markets Intelligence?**
A: The workflow will flag it as stale on the next run. Timestamp verification shows which sections need updating.

**Q: Can I change the character limit?**
A: Yes, but 600 chars is optimal for dashboard display. Going longer makes content less scannable, going shorter may lose critical details.

**Q: What's the difference from Daily Planner?**
A: Visually identical layout and field structure. Functionally, both use same Claude Code synthesis approach within the wingman workflow.
