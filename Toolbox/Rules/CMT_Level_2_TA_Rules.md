- If right shoulder high = 192, stop = 193

**Profit Target Placement:**
- Measure distance from head to neckline

- OBV making higher highs and higher lows
- OBV breakout above previous resistance level

**Bearish Signals:**
- OBV trend line breaks downward
- OBV making lower highs and lower lows

**Definition:** Shows where volume (price levels) accumulated over time

**Entry Rules:**
- High volume nodes = strong support/resistance
- Price breakout from high-volume zone needs volume expansion
- Price at Point of Control (POC) = popular price level

**Entry Signals:**
- Price rallies from low-volume area = weak resistance ahead
- Price breaks through high-volume node with spike volume = strong signal
- POC acts as magnet for price

**Confirmation Requirements:**
- Volume spike on breakout (50%+ above average)
- Price close confirms direction
- No immediate reversal

**Stop Loss:**
- Just beyond previous volume node
- Or use support/resistance stop

**Profit Target:**

- Or use R:R projection

**Risk/Reward Minimum:** 1:1.5

**Role Reversal:**
- Once resistance is broken, it becomes support
- Once support is broken, it becomes resistance
- These are magnet levels for price to return to

**Scoring:**
- Clear, tested level: 70 points
- Breakout with volume expansion: +20 points
- Multiple tests confirm level: +10 points
- **Score: 70-100**

---

### 15. Pivot Points

**Standard Pivot Formula:**
- **Pivot (P):** (High + Low + Close) / 3
- **Resistance 1 (R1):** (2 × P) - Low
- **Support 1 (S1):** (2 × P) - High
- **Resistance 2 (R2):** P + (High - Low)
- **Support 2 (S2):** P - (High - Low)

**Usage Rules:**

## Confirmation Standards

### 18. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation Rule

**Primary Rule:**
Before entry, MUST confirm on at least TWO timeframes that trend direction is correct

**Confirmation Cascade:**

**For Daily Entries:**
1. Daily chart shows valid setup (pattern/trend/indicator signal)
2. 4-hour chart CONFIRMS direction (no counter signals)
3. 1-hour chart shows entry candle in correct direction
4. Entry taken on 1-hour candle close

**For 4-Hour Entries:**
1. 4-hour chart shows valid setup
2. 1-hour chart CONFIRMS direction
3. 15-minute chart shows entry candle
4. Entry taken on 15-minute candle close

**For 1-Hour Entries:**
1. 1-hour chart shows valid setup
2. 15-minute chart CONFIRMS direction
3. 5-minute chart shows entry candle
4. Entry taken on 5-minute candle close

**Scoring:**
- Setup confirmed on 2 timeframes: 75 points
- Setup confirmed on 3 timeframes: +15 points
- Setup confirmed on all timeframes: +10 points
- **Score: 75-100**

---

### 19. Volume Confirmation Rule

**Rule:** All major price moves must have volume expansion

**Minimum Volume Requirements:**

**For Support/Resistance Breakouts:**
- Volume must be 50% above 20-day average
- Example: If 20-day avg = 1M shares, need 1.5M shares on breakout

**For Pattern Breakouts (flags, triangles, H&S):**
- Volume must be 50%+ above average
- Stronger signal if volume 100%+ above average

**For Trend Moves:**
- Uptrend: Volume on up days > volume on down days
- Downtrend: Volume on down days > volume on up days

**For Divergence Confirmation:**
- Volume should expand in direction of divergence reversal
- Example: Bullish divergence → price breakout should have volume spike

**When Volume is Lacking:**
- Signals are suspect
- Reduce position size by 50%
- Increase stop distance (wider stop needed)

**Scoring:**
- Volume spike 50% above average: 75 points
- Volume spike 100% above average: +10 points
- Volume confirms all entry conditions: +15 points
- **Score: 75-100**

---

### 20. Breadth & Market Alignment Rule

**Rule:** Individual stocks perform better when aligned with major index trends

**Alignment Criteria:**

**For Long Entries (Bullish Setup):**
- Check: Is SPY in uptrend? (EMA 20 > 50 > 200)
- Check: Is QQQ in uptrend? (for tech stocks)
- Check: Is stock outperforming or just following?
- Stock entry quality HIGHER if index is strong

**For Short Entries (Bearish Setup):**
- Check: Is SPY in downtrend?
- Check: Is QQQ in downtrend? (for tech)
- Check: Is stock weaker than market?
- Stock entry quality HIGHER if index is weak

**Breadth Signals:**
- Strong breadth (80%+ of stocks up): Bullish environment
- Weak breadth (20%+ of stocks down in uptrend): Warning signal
- Extreme breadth (90%+): Potential reversal coming

**Scoring Impact:**
- Stock aligned with strong index trend: +20 points
- Stock aligned with weak index: +10 points
- Stock against index trend: -15 points (reduce or skip trade)

## Scoring Guide

### How to Score a Trade Setup

**Step 1: Identify the Pattern/Signal**
- Is this a chart pattern? (Head & Shoulders, triangle, flag, etc.)
- Is this a trend move? (Moving average, trend line bounce)
- Is this a momentum signal? (RSI, MACD, OBV)
- Is this a divergence? (Bullish or bearish)

**Step 2: Base Score Assignment**
- Each rule above has a base score (65-85 points typically)
- Write down the base score for your pattern

**Step 3: Add Confirmation Points**
- Multi-timeframe confirmation: +10-20 points
- Volume expansion: +10-20 points
- Market alignment: +10-20 points
- Divergence present: +10-20 points

**Step 4: Deduct for Red Flags**
- Weak volume: -10-15 points
- Against market trend: -15-20 points
- Level not well-defined: -5-10 points
- Too tight/compressed: -5-10 points

**Step 5: Final TA Score (0-100)**
- 0-33: AVOID (bearish setup)
- 34-66: WAIT (neutral/uncertain)
- 67-100: BUY (bullish setup)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Head & Shoulders pattern identified: Base 85
- Multi-timeframe confirmation (3x): +15
- Volume expansion on breakdown: +10
- Well-defined neckline: +5
- RSI divergence confirmed: +5
- Against SPY trend: -10

TOTAL TA SCORE: 110 → CAPPED AT 100
```

## Implementation Notes

**These rules are applied by the Real-Time Analysis Engine** when you ask "analyze [TICKER]"

The engine will:
1. Identify current pattern/signals on daily chart
2. Check multi-timeframe alignment
3. Verify volume conditions
4. Calculate TA score (0-100)
5. Return score + reasoning

**Used in Probability Formula:**
- TA_Score × 0.40 = Component of overall probability score
- Combined with market context (25%), sentiment (15%), volume (10%), seasonality (10%)
- Final score: 0-100 → AVOID / WAIT / BUY recommendation
