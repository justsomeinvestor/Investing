## **Trade Log: SPY Short Attempt via SPXU**
- **Instrument:** SPXU (inverse SPY ETF)
- **Entry:** $13.60  
- **Exit:** $13.57  
- **Quantity:** 500 shares  
- **Execution:** Market order (EXTO eligible).  
- **Intent:** Fade 663–665 resistance with target toward 657–654.  

### **Result**
- Closed at minor loss after 5-minute 200 EMA flattening signaled failed breakdown.
- Market instead rebounded off 661.37 (50% retrace of 652.8→673.9 swing).  

### **Key Takeaways**
- Correct resistance call but no structural confirmation.
- 5-min 200 EMA shifted from down → flat → up.
- ADD improved from –1300 → +50 during trade window.  
- RSI stayed above 40 → no momentum confirmation.

## **Post-Mortem: Why the Trade Failed**
| Factor | Observation | Lesson |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Structure | No close below 659.5 | Require close+retest (C+R) confirmation before fading |
| EMA posture | 5-min 200 EMA flat | Only short when 200 EMA is falling |
| Breadth | ADD improving | Don’t fade improving internals |
| Context | Above 20 EMA daily | Counter-trend trades must be half-size |
| Instrument | SPXU | Better for trends, not range fades |

**Updated System Rules:**
- **Short Trigger:** SPY C+R < 659.5, QQQ < 600.9, ADD ≤ –500, 5-min 200 EMA down, 1.3× volume.  
- **Long Trigger:** SPY C+R > 665.5, ADD ≥ +500, 5-min 200 EMA up, 1.3× volume.

## **Midday Market Matrix**
| Asset | Price | Technical Context | Bias |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **SPY** | 662.16 | 50% retrace (661.3) held; below 20-day EMA 664.7 | Neutral-bear |
| **QQQ** | 598.0 | Above 50% retrace (597); MACD rolling | Weak |
| **BTC** | 113k | Holding 111–116k range | Stabilizing |
| **ETH** | 4117 | Below EMA cluster 4170–4323 | Weak bounce |
| **SOLZ** | 20.9 | Rejecting trendline near 22.3 | Bearish |
| **DXY** | 99.64 | Targeting 100.25 Fib; firm dollar | Bearish for risk |

| **SADD** | +889 | Defensive bias | Mild risk-off |

## **End-of-Day Analysis**
**Tape summary:**  
- Market respected liquidity levels and 50% retraces.  
- SPY/QQQ held mid-range support; no new breakdown.  
- Crypto mirrored equity risk tone.  
- DXY remains the headwind; no reversal yet.  

**Psychology:** Stayed patient, exited without revenge trading, and respected system filters.  

**Overall Bias into Tomorrow:**
- Neutral-bull above 661, bearish if <659.5 with confirmation.  
- Watch for reaction to ASML/TSM earnings overnight.  

---

## **Final Notes**
- **Account:** Flat with ~$22.8K balance.  
- **Execution quality:** Disciplined, early exit saved capital.
- **Improvement focus:**
  - Confirm multi-timeframe alignment (5m, 30m, daily) before entries.
  - Use ADD/QQQ confirmation filters.  
  - Review fib and VWAP confluence ahead of trades.

**Next Session Checklist:**
1. Plot SPY 659.5 / 665.5 as inflection zones.  
2. Monitor ADD/STICK/DXY alignment.  
3. Await high-volume confirmation moves; avoid pre-emptive fades.  
4. Maintain composure — trade what’s confirmed, not what’s expected.
