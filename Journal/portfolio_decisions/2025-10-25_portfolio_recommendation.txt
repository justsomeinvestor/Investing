RECOMMENDATION:
Target: 40% cash, 30% equities, 20% crypto, 10% hedges

ACTIONS:
- Deploy $6,933 to SPY/QQQ (30% equities) on breadth confirmation >70% up-volume
- Add $4,622 to BTC/ETH (20% crypto) positioning with 15% of capital deployed
- Maintain $9,242 cash for opportunities during Fed volatility Oct 29
- Add $929 to VIX calls (10% hedges) as insurance through Oct 29

REASONING:
Signal moderately bullish (57/100) with clear breadth bottleneck waiting for resolution. Fed Oct 29 guidance will determine next legâ€”dovish scenario supports risk deployment with breadth improvement, while hawkish maintains defensive positioning. Current setup favors waiting for confirmation rather than chasing consolidation; this allocation sizes properly for both scenarios post-Fed while respecting risk management constraints.

KEY RISKS:
- Fed hawkish surprise could trigger immediate 2-3% SPY drawdown requiring hedge execution
- Breadth failure to thrust >70% would invalidate bullish setup despite price strength
- Concentration in mega-cap tech (NVDA/MSFT/AAPL) creates index rally fragility
- CPI inflation narrative could reverse if energy prices spike or labor data disappoints
