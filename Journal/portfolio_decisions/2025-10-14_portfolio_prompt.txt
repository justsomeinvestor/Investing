The market is currently in a state of high alert, caught between the dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. While strong earnings from the banking sector and the ongoing AI narrative provide some support, the overarching sentiment is one of caution and risk aversion. The recent VIX spike and the flight to safety in bonds underscore the market's anxiety over geopolitical tensions.

**Risk Level:**
The risk level is high due to the combination of geopolitical tensions, high market volatility, and the potential for a significant market correction.

**Sentiment Score:**
The overall sentiment is bearish due to the high level of uncertainty and risk aversion in the market. While there are some bullish factors, the escalating trade war is the dominant narrative and is weighing on investor confidence.

The macro sentiment on X is bearish, dominated by concerns over the escalating U.S.-China trade war and its potential impact on global growth. The recent spike in the VIX and the flight to safety in bonds are key topics of discussion.
