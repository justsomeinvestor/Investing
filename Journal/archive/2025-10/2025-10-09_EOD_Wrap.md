# End-of-Day Wrap — 2025-10-09

**Generated:** 2025-10-09 20:46:18

**Market Sentiment (Today):** S&P pinned Max Pain while signal stayed STRONG; breadth divergence and VIX compression in focus.
- SPY: Close ≈ **~670** (pin toward Max Pain noted intraday).  *Exact OHLC: fill in from data feed.*

## 2) Max Pain Dashboard
| Ticker | Nearest Expiry | Max Pain | Spot @Open | Spot @Close | Dist% @Open | Dist% @Close | MP Drift | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| SPY | Fri wkly | **670** | ___ | ~670 | ___ | ~0% | obs: stable | Pinned late day |
| NVDA | Fri wkly | **190** | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ | unknown | Watched 190 as reactive level |

## 3) Pinch → Expansion Review
- Repeated compressions near key levels; SPY coiled around 670, NVDA coiled around VWAP.
- Late recovery in SPY toward 670; NVDA VWAP tests governed exits per rule.

## 5) What Worked / What Hurt
- **Worked:** Waiting for 5m close below midpoint avoided a premature exit; respect for MP magnet improved context.
- **Hurt:** Early trigger before bar close; late-session pin risk near 670 increased odds of squeeze against NVD.
- **Filter to enforce:** VWAP **close+retest** rule and **MP band filter** (scale down within ±0.3% of MP).

## 6) System Notes
- Add **Max Pain overlay** (+ bands) to SPY/QQQ/NVDA.
- Keep **VWAP close+retest stop** with ATR buffers (0.15 soft / 0.30 hard).
- Track **pinch → expansion** events (squeeze/wedge scripts).

## 7) Plan for Tomorrow
- SPY: MP 670 baseline; levels 668.7 / 667.2 / 665, PDH/PDL/WO/WM.
- NVDA: watch 190; trade acceptance relative to VWAP; breadth filter.
