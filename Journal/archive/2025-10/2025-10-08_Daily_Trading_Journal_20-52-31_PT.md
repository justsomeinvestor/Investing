## 🧠 Observations & Insights

- **Plan vs. Market:**  
  - Noted a strong early **upthrust** (~07:00 PT). Expected **uncertainty/flattening** into FOMC → move back to **Weekly Midpoint (WM ~670.44)** from **Weekly Open (WO ~671.62)**.  
  - Price **wicked** below WO toward WM/PD Mid, but that proved to be a **liquidity sweep**; no acceptance below. Rally resumed; **SPY** printed **HOD ~673.21**; **QQQ** later extended to its **161.8%** fib extension while SPY stalled.

- **Trigger Discipline (Key Learning):**  
  - I **did not follow my Thinkorswim trigger rules** (volatility + higher-TF levels + volume profile gates).  
  - Although WO was correctly identified, **no short trigger actually fired** when I began building **SPXU**. That was the central mistake.  
  - Later, near **yesterday’s highs**, I **did** get short signals on the system; price formed a **sideways squeeze**, then **dumped** to **672.17** (retest of the morning high) **twice** (double test), then turned back up—**QQQ** led the breakout; **SPY** lagged.

- **Execution Review:**  
  - Built SPXU **before confirmation** (no 15–30m LH/LL sequence, no lasting VWAP loss, breadth didn’t stay negative).  
  - Flipped to SPXL after invalidation; day finished modest red.

## ✅ Actionable Rules (to print on chart)

1. **Do not fade trend without a trigger.**  
   - Need **2 of 3**: (a) **VWAP lost & held**, (b) **breadth deteriorates** (A/D, cumulative TICK < 0 for 30–60m), (c) **15–30m LH → LL** sequence.
2. **Reference levels checklist** (must align with triggers): **WO / WM / PD Mid / PDH / PDL**. A **wick** ≠ acceptance.
3. **Invalidation ladder (pre-declared):**  
   - Reduce on **VWAP reclaim**, cut on **HOD reclaim**, exit on **breadth flip > 0 and holds**.  
4. **Sizing:** First entry ≤ **0.25R**; max 3 adds **only** on improved signals.  
5. **Flip protocol:** On invalidation, require **HL → HH** sequence before flipping long to avoid chop.

## 💡 Workflow Tweaks

- Add a **“Trigger Status” panel** to the chart (VWAP state, breadth, 15–30m structure) that lights green only when **2/3** conditions are met.  
- Create alerts on **WO/WM/PD Mid** that **only fire if VWAP condition matches** (avoid reacting to wicks).

## 🧾 One-liner for future me

> Correct level read (WO/WM), but I **front-ran** the short without a trigger. The WM tag was a **wick**, not acceptance; QQQ then led to the **161.8%** extension while SPY lagged. **Follow triggers first**, then size.
