**Generated:** 2025-10-10 21:08:15 PT

**Market Sentiment (Today):** NVDA strength on prior-day buy signals; **QQQ leading** while **SPY lagged/rolled**. Tried to ride continuation on NVDA; later probed SOLZ long off channel level as BTC/crypto slowed its sell.
**Market Sentiment (Today):** NVDA strength on prior-day buy signals; QQQ leading while SPY lagged/rolled; kept crypto channel bounce on tight leash.

**Key Events/Catalysts (Today):** None scheduled for me; focus on **tech leadership** and **crypto channel levels**.

## ðŸ“Š P&L Summary (intraday)
- **NVDL:** +0.95% on the combined lot (took profits near range high)
- **SOLZ:** ~+0.14% (approx) on early bounce, later **stopped out** as momentum failed
- **EOD:** Flat elsewhere

## ðŸ§  Observations & Insights
- **Setups:** NVDA continuation aligned with prior-day system **buy triggers**; followed through well. **QQQ led** while **SPY** didnâ€™t break out the same wayâ€”leadership divergence persisted.
- **Discipline:** Today I **did** respect triggers for the NVDA idea (better than 10/08). For SOLZ, I took a **first-touch channel** entry but respected weakness and cut.
- **Levels of note:** NVDA reclaim of intraday VWAP and 20EMA support; targets in mind were **195** then **200**; fib context watching **127% / 168%** on lower TF.

## ðŸŽ¯ Targets & Stop Management (playbook snippets)

**For continuation longs (NVDA/NVDL-type):**
1. **Primary targets:** prior-day HOD â†’ intraday measured move â†’ **Fib 127% â†’ 161.8%** of the impulse leg.
2. **Trailing stop options (choose one before entry):**
   - **Structure trail:** last **swing low (5â€“15m)** âˆ’ tick; move to BE after **+1R**; ratchet only on new HH.
   - **VWAP/EMA trail:** exit on **5m VWAP close below** _and_ loss of **EMA20** (no wick outs); re-enter on reclaim if signal persists.
   - **ATR Chandelier:** **ATR(14) Ã— 2.5** below highest close since entry.
3. **Reduce into extensions:** Scale 1/3 at **127%**, 1/3 at **161.8%**, run remainder with the trail.

**For first-touch channel bounces (SOLZ-type):**
1. Entry only with **RSI divergence or volume expansion**; invalidate if **VWAP rejection** persists 2 bars.
2. Hard stop: below channel by **0.5Ã—ATR** or below the **prior swing low**.
3. If BTC/crypto breadth flips down, **no adds**â€”treat bounce as scalp only.

## âœ… Actionable Rules for Tomorrow
- Declare **target ladder + trailing method** **before** clicking buy (no improvising mid-trade).
- Prefer **QQQ-lead tech** names for follow-through; if **SPY lags**, avoid fading QQQ strength.
- Keep first entry â‰¤ **0.25R**; only add after **HL â†’ HH** with rising volume.

## ðŸ§¾ One-liner for future me
> Let leadership guide me: rode NVDA continuation with system confirmation; took quick profits. Crypto bounce was tacticalâ€”cut when breadth didnâ€™t follow. Pre-commit targets and the trailing method.
