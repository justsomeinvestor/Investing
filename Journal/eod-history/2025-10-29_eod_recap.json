  "summary": "Live Trading Session #4: FOMC Binary Event + Thesis Validation Day. Trade #7 positioned overnight into FOMC and executed perfectly. FOMC announced dovish 25bps cut + QT ending at 18:00 ET. Initial catalyst-driven rally through resistance (expected override). Pilot/Wingman monitored post-FOMC \"sell the news\" reversal setup: SPX at 168% Fib exhaustion, breadth divergence (SPY/QQQ weak vs mega-caps rallying), narrow leadership breaking. Exited Trade #7 at market close (12:38 PM before FOMC) at +$60 profit. Risk management decision: Avoid overnight gap risk on binary event. Morning extension thesis VINDICATED by post-FOMC structure. YTD P/L now +$3,239.57.",
