INTRADAY TRADING RULES - SPECIALIZED FOR 5-MIN, 15-MIN, 1-HOUR DAYTRADING
================================================================================

CORE PHILOSOPHY:
Intraday trading is PRECISION-based, not emotion-based. Every entry must be pre-planned,
every exit must be mechanical, every trade must be analyzed for learning.

This document extends Rules #0-20 with intraday-specific protocols.

================================================================================
RULE #0: CONFLUENCE FRAMEWORK (INTRADAY ADAPTATION)
================================================================================

CORE REQUIREMENT: Never trade on single reason. Require 3+ independent confluences.

INTRADAY CONFLUENCE HIERARCHY (Ranked by Predictive Power):

TIER 1 - STRONGEST (Each worth +1.5x weight):
  1. VWAP colored arrow + divergence confirmed (70%+ win rate)
  2. Bearish/bullish divergence RSI (3-candle confirmed per Rule #19)
  3. Fibonacci extension at exhaustion level (127% or 168%)
  4. Multi-timeframe alignment (all 3 TF aligned) = +2 confluence points

TIER 2 - STRONG (Each worth +1x weight):
  5. Breadth confirmation (ADD > +500 for longs, < -500 for shorts)
  6. VWAP red/orange arrow (without divergence confirmation)
  7. Volume > 1.5x average on entry signal
  8. C+R confirmation (close + retest per Rule #7, #9)

TIER 3 - MODERATE (Each worth +0.5x weight):
  9. EMA alignment (5-min 200 EMA trending with thesis)
  10. MACD cross confirmation
  11. Andy level alignment (if Andy's accuracy > 60%)
  12. Session-time favorable (opening or power hour, not lunch)

TIER 4 - WEAK (Each worth +0.25x weight):
  13. Max pain alignment (if Friday option expiration)
  14. Seasonal pattern
  15. Previous day structure alignment

SCORING SYSTEM:
Minimum Requirement: 3 tier-2 confluences (3.0 points)
                      OR 2 tier-1 + 1 tier-2 (3.5 points)
                      OR 1 tier-1 + 2 tier-2 + 1 tier-3 (3.25 points)

Standard Entry: 4+ confluences (4+ points)
High Conviction: 5+ confluences (5+ points)
Premium Setup: 6+ confluences (6+ points) - SCALE UP

EXAMPLE CALCULATION (Oct 29 SPY trade):
  - VWAP red arrow + divergence (Tier 1): +1.5
  - ADD negative (Tier 2): +1.0
  - FOMC catalyst (Tier 2): +1.0
  - SPX 168% Fib (Tier 1): +1.5
  - Narrow leadership (Tier 2): +1.0
  - Andy alignment (Tier 3): +0.5
  = 6.5 confluence points = PREMIUM SETUP = High conviction

INTRADAY-SPECIFIC: Confluences must form within 1-5 minutes.
If setup takes >5 min to develop, confluence weakens (window closed).

================================================================================
RULE #19: DIVERGENCE CONFIRMATION (INTRADAY PROTOCOL)
================================================================================

CORE REQUIREMENT: Divergences are early reversal signals, but must be confirmed
within 3-candle window BEFORE entry.

PROCESS (MANDATORY):
1. Spot divergence: Price higher high, RSI/MACD lower high
2. Set observation: 3-candle window (15 min on 5-min chart)
3. Confirmation: Price MUST reverse within 3 candles
4. Entry: After confirmation bar closes
5. Failure: If price continues past divergence high after 3 bars, PASS trade

MULTI-TIMEFRAME DIVERGENCE:
  5-min + 15-min both showing divergence: 78% win rate (STRONG)
  5-min only: 65% win rate (moderate)
  15-min only: 70% win rate (moderate)

REQUIREMENTS BY TIMEFRAME:
  5-min: RSI divergence at extension (RSI > 80 or < 20)
         Volume confirmation on reversal bar
         2 of 3 candles must reverse direction

  15-min: MACD histogram divergence (momentum not confirming price)
          Volume >= 1.3x average on reversal bar
          1 candle reversal sufficient (trend stronger on 15-min)

  1-hour: RSI divergence at hourly resistance/support
          MACD cross confirmation
          Can skip 3-candle rule (slower timeframe)

FALSE SIGNAL MANAGEMENT:
  If divergence fails to confirm within 3 candles: BLACKLIST that level
  for next 30 minutes (price won't reverse there twice in quick succession)

TRACKING (add to learning database):
  - Divergence spotted?
  - Confirmed within 3 candles?
  - Win rate of confirmed vs unconfirmed divergences
  - By market regime (trending vs choppy)

================================================================================
RULE #20: TWO-WAY FIBONACCI REVERSION (INTRADAY IMPLEMENTATION)
================================================================================

CORE FRAMEWORK: Price extends to Fibonacci level, then reverts. Sell extensions,
buy pullbacks. Tightest stops in your arsenal = mechanical discipline.

EXTENSION SELL SETUP (Fade the Move):

  Entry Criteria:
    1. Price extends to 127% or 168% Fibonacci level
    2. Bearish divergence on same timeframe (Rule #19)
    3. VWAP shows red or orange arrow
    4. Volume >= 1.5x average on extension bar
    5. EMA filter aligned (200 EMA falling)
    6. Breadth confirmation (ADD < -500 or weakening)
    7. Risk can be defined (<= 1% account max)

  Entry Process:
    1. Identify extension level (use ThinkOrSwim Fibonacci auto-draw)
    2. Wait for price to REACH level (don't chase from 10 points away)
    3. Confirm divergence + VWAP on entry bar
    4. Pre-set stop at extension high + 0.05% buffer
    5. Calculate target: 50% of extended move
    6. Enter at extension level close

  Stop Management:
    5-min: Stop at extension high + 0.05% (tight, mechanical)
    15-min: Stop at extension high + 0.1%
    1-hour: Stop at extension high + 0.2%

    NO ADJUSTMENT: Stop does not move until target hit. Zero flexibility.

  Target Management:
    Primary target: 50% Fibonacci pullback (TAKE 50% profit)
    Secondary target: 61.8% pullback (trail remainder with stop-loss)

    Exit Rules:
      - If 50% target hit: Exit half position, trail remainder
      - If 3x bars held without progress: Exit for breakeven
      - If breadth suddenly improves: Exit (thesis broken)

  Position Sizing:
    Risk = (extension high - entry) * shares = max $231 (1% account)
    Calculate shares from risk:

    Example:
    Extension at 685.00, stop at 686.50 = $1.50 risk
    Max risk per trade = $231
    Shares = $231 / $1.50 = 154 shares

    Entry at 684.50: -154 shares (short 154 SPXU)

PULLBACK BUY SETUP (Buy the Dip at Structure):

  Entry Criteria:
    1. Previous extension completed (pullback phase)
    2. Price pulls back to 50%-61.8% Fibonacci zone
    3. HARD LEVEL confluence present:
       - Weekly mid-point OR
       - Monthly high/low OR
       - Previous support/resistance structure
    4. Bullish divergence forming (RSI, MACD)
    5. VWAP reclaim on 15-min or lower
    6. Breadth improving (ADD > +500 or turning up)
    7. 4+ confluences minimum (higher bar than extension fade)

  Entry Process:
    1. Identify pullback zone (50%-61.8%)
    2. Identify hard level (weekly mid, etc.)
    3. Wait for convergence: pullback zone + hard level intersection
    4. Confirm technical setup (bullish divergence)
    5. Pre-set stop: Below hard level - buffer
    6. Target: Previous extension level or beyond
    7. Enter at hard level support

  Stop Management:
    Stop placed BELOW hard level (not at, but below)
    5-min: Below support by 0.05%
    15-min: Below support by 0.1%
    1-hour: Below support by 0.2%

    NO ADJUSTMENT: Hard stop, no trailing initially.

  Target Management:
    Primary target: Return to extension level
    Secondary target: New high beyond extension

    Exit Rules:
      - If extension level hit: Exit 100% (confirmed cycle)
      - If 8 bars held without progress: Exit for breakeven
      - If close below hard level intraday: Exit immediately (stop)

  Position Sizing:
    Risk = (entry - hard level low) * shares = max $231
    Size accordingly

    Example:
    Hard level 682.00, entry 682.50 = $0.50 risk
    Max risk = $231
    Shares = $231 / $0.50 = 462 shares

    Entry at 682.50: +462 shares (long 462 SPXU)

TRACKING TWO-WAY CYCLES:
  - Extension sell win rate (target: 65%+)
  - Pullback buy win rate (target: 65%+)
  - Two-way completion rate (% of cycles that produce both trades)
  - Average R/R per full cycle
  - Fibonacci level accuracy (127% vs 168%)

================================================================================
RULE #21: MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFIRMATION (NEW - INTRADAY SPECIFIC)
================================================================================

CORE REQUIREMENT: Before entry on any timeframe, confirm alignment across 3 TF.

PROCESS:
  1. Spot setup on PRIMARY timeframe (5-min, 15-min, or 1-hour)
  2. Check SECONDARY timeframe (one level up)
  3. Check TERTIARY timeframe (one level higher)
  4. Calculate alignment score (3/3, 2/3, 1/3, 0/3)

ALIGNMENT SCORING:
  3/3 Aligned: All 3 timeframes showing same direction signal
    Position sizing: 100% normal size (full conviction)

  2/3 Aligned: 2 of 3 timeframes aligned
    Position sizing: 75% normal size (standard trade)

  1/3 Aligned: Only primary timeframe showing signal
    Position sizing: 50% normal size OR PASS (counter-trend risk)

  0/3 Aligned: Multi-timeframe divergence
    ACTION: PASS - High reversal risk, conflicting signals

EXAMPLE (Entry on 5-min):
  5-min: VWAP red arrow, divergence (SELL setup)
  15-min: Channel resistance, MACD divergence (SELL setup)
  1-hour: SPX at Fib extension (SELL setup)
  = 3/3 ALIGNED → Full size (100%)

EXAMPLE (Entry on 5-min):
  5-min: VWAP red arrow (SELL setup)
  15-min: Just broke support (SELL setup)
  1-hour: Slight uptrend continuing (BUY setup)
  = 2/3 aligned (SELL vs SELL, 1 BUY) → 75% size

EXAMPLE (Entry on 15-min):
  15-min: C+R breakdown (SHORT)
  5-min: Oversold RSI, bouncing up (LONG setup - counter)
  1-hour: Uptrend intact (LONG setup - counter)
  = 1/3 aligned → 50% size OR PASS

MANDATORY CHECKLIST ITEM: "Multi-timeframe alignment confirmed?"

================================================================================
RULE #22: SESSION-SPECIFIC POSITION SIZING
================================================================================

CORE REQUIREMENT: Market conditions change by time of day. Adjust size accordingly.

SESSION DEFINITIONS (All times ET):

SESSION 1 - OPENING RANGE (9:30 AM - 10:00 AM):
  Market Characteristics:
    - Highest volume of day
    - Large moves common (gaps, overnight reactions)
    - Setup quality HIGH (clear directional signal)
    - Volatility: ELEVATED but structured

  Position Sizing: 100% STANDARD
  Best Setups: ORB breakout, opening retest, gap fades
  Risk Level: ACCEPTABLE (high volume = defined risk)

  Rules:
    - Allow full-size entries if 3+ confluences present
    - Tight stops (opening range extremes)
    - Target: 2x opening range size
    - No mercy: Stop hits = exit immediately (may retest)

SESSION 2 - TREND DEVELOPMENT (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM):
  Market Characteristics:
    - Strong trending periods historically
    - Volume elevated, momentum strong
    - Setup quality: HIGH (follow extension moves)
    - Breadth usually confirming

  Position Sizing: 100% STANDARD
  Best Setups: VWAP extension fades, C+R breaks, momentum follow
  Risk Level: ACCEPTABLE (trending = directional clarity)

  Rules:
    - Favor extension SELL setups (market usually pulls back after 10:30)
    - Trail stops wider (trends can run)
    - Target: 50%-61.8% pullback
    - Add-on opportunity if pullback confirmed

SESSION 3 - LUNCH CHOP (11:30 AM - 2:00 PM):
  Market Characteristics:
    - Lowest volume of day
    - Whipsaws VERY COMMON
    - Setup quality: POOR (false breakouts, fades fail)
    - Directional clarity LOW
    - Volatility: HIGH due to low volume (wider spreads)

  Position Sizing: 50% REDUCED OR SKIP ENTIRELY
  Best Strategy: AVOID NEW ENTRIES (wait for power hour)
  Alternative: Manage existing positions only
  Risk Level: UNACCEPTABLE (low conviction + whipsaws)

  Rules:
    - If you must trade: Only ultra-high-confluence setups (6+ points)
    - Use half normal size (50%)
    - Tighter stops (whipsaws likely)
    - BETTER: Close morning positions, take break, return 2 PM
    - Historically: Win rate <50% in lunch chop

SESSION 4 - POWER HOUR (2:00 PM - 3:45 PM):
  Market Characteristics:
    - Volume returns strongly
    - Trends resume or reverse
    - Setup quality: HIGH (pullback opportunities develop)
    - Breadth usually confirming
    - Position building begins for next day

  Position Sizing: 100-125% STANDARD (can increase if high conviction)
  Best Setups: Fibonacci pullbacks, VWAP reversions, structure bounces
  Risk Level: ACCEPTABLE-HIGH (high quality + high volume)

  Rules:
    - This is premium trading time (matched with morning)
    - Allow full-size + 25% increase on 6+ confluence setups
    - Best pullback buy entries happen here (5+ confluences common)
    - Favor longer holds (1-3 hour targets)
    - Can hold into next day if structure intact

SESSION 5 - MARKET CLOSE (3:45 PM - 4:00 PM):
  Market Characteristics:
    - Final 15 minutes: often violent and emotional
    - Fund positioning, index rebalancing
    - Setup quality: POOR (desperation moves, fades)
    - Volatility: EXTREME (wider spreads, quick reversals)

  Position Sizing: ZERO - NO NEW ENTRIES (Rule #5)
  Best Strategy: EXIT MANAGEMENT ONLY

  Rules:
    - RULE #5: No new initiations in final 15 minutes
    - Close profitable positions (don't give back profits)
    - Trail stop on winners only
    - Accept breakeven exits (don't chase)
    - If you have overnight position: set stop NOW (don't hold into next day surprise)

SUMMARY TABLE:
  9:30-10:00: 100% (Opening is PRIME time)
  10:00-11:30: 100% (Trend development = strong setups)
  11:30-2:00: 50% (Lunch chop = skip if possible)
  2:00-3:45: 100-125% (Power hour = best pullbacks)
  3:45-4:00: 0% (Exits only, no entries)

TRACKING:
  Calculate win rate by session. If any session <50%, reduce size further or skip.
  After 10 trades per session, you'll know if that time period is profitable.

================================================================================
RULE #23: MAXIMUM DAILY LOSS LIMIT (STOP TRADING)
================================================================================

CORE REQUIREMENT: Protect capital from revenge trading and tilt.

MECHANISM:
  Daily Loss Limit = 2% of account = $500 (based on $25,000 account)

  Threshold: After -$500 realized loss for the day, STOP TRADING.
  No new entries. No adding to losers. No revenge trades.

  Exception: If holding profitable position from morning, manage exit only.
             Can hold winning trade into close, but no NEW entries.

CALCULATION:
  Track cumulative daily realized losses (closed trades only).
  When realized P/L hits -$500 (or -2%), STOP.

  Example:
  Trade 1: -$150 (total: -$150)
  Trade 2: -$200 (total: -$350)
  Trade 3: -$180 (total: -$530) → STOP TRADING

  No Trade 4, 5, or 6 today. Done for the day.

PURPOSE:
  - Prevents compounding losses (recovery psychology is false)
  - Enforces break/reset (step away, reset mindset)
  - Protects capital for tomorrow
  - Documented rule prevents emotion-based exceptions

IMPLEMENTATION:
  Pre-entry checklist item #18: "Daily loss limit not exceeded?"
  If YES, do not enter. Close program if necessary to avoid temptation.

================================================================================
RULE #24: CHECKLIST COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT (NEW)
================================================================================

CORE REQUIREMENT: Every intraday trade must pass pre-entry checklist before entry.

PRE-ENTRY CHECKLIST (18 Items - Intraday Version):

  SETUP IDENTIFICATION:
    1. Primary setup type identified (VWAP/ORB/C+R/Fib)?
    2. Secondary confluence(s) present (minimum 3 total)?
    3. Multi-timeframe alignment confirmed (Rule #21)?
    4. Confluence count >= 3 (Go/No-Go signal)?

  TECHNICAL VALIDATION:
    5. Divergence confirmed within 3-candle window (Rule #19)?
    6. Volume >= 1.3x average on entry bar?
    7. EMA filter passed (200 EMA aligned)?
    8. VWAP status aligned with thesis (arrow color correct)?

  RISK MANAGEMENT:
    9. Stop price clearly defined (mechanical, no subjective)?
    10. Risk amount calculated (<= 1% account = $231 max)?
    11. Target price pre-set (before entry)?
    12. Position size calculated from risk?

  MARKET CONTEXT:
    13. Session time favorable (not lunch chop)?
    14. Breadth/ADD aligned (not counter-trend)?
    15. VIX regime noted (adjust stops/size by regime)?
    16. Andy levels checked (if available)?

  FINAL CHECKS:
    17. Checklist compliance rate calculated (all 16 above = 16/16)?
    18. Daily loss limit not exceeded (Rule #23)?

GO CRITERIA: All 18 items checked = GREEN LIGHT
NO-GO: Any 2+ items unchecked OR confluence < 3 = RED LIGHT

TRACKING:
  Track checklist compliance per trade
  After 10 trades: Calculate compliance percentage
  Find correlation: Higher compliance = higher win rate?
  EXPECTED: 90%+ compliance correlates to 60%+ win rate

================================================================================

================================================================================
INTEGRATION WITH SWING TRADING (Rule #0-20 Existing)
================================================================================

Your existing swing position (Trade #7 SPXU) and intraday day trading are SEPARATE.

SEPARATION:
  Swing Trade (Trade #7):
    - Position size: 600 shares (29.7% account risk)
    - Hold: Multi-day (stop at $12.38, target $12.20)
    - Goal: Capture 50%-61.8% pullback of SPX extension
    - Update: Check daily, manage exits if rules triggered

  Intraday Trades:
    - Position size: Micro (1-3% account risk per trade)
    - Hold: Intraday (1-20 bars, minutes to hours)
    - Goal: Capture quick reversions, ORB moves, pullbacks
    - Update: Real-time, check every 5 minutes

DO NOT:
  - Add to swing trade with intraday capital
  - Use swing position stop for intraday entries
  - Mix intraday convictions into swing thesis
  - Over-leverage: Swing (29.7%) + Intraday (2-3% per) = max 32-33% account

DO:
  - Manage swing position separately (EOD check)
  - Use intraday capital for separate setups
  - Sync Andy calls with both timeframe systems
  - Update intraday learning database independently
  - Track: Intraday P/L separately from swing P/L

================================================================================
LEARNING & CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

WEEKLY REVIEW (Every Friday 4:30 PM):
  1. Compile all 5-15 intraday trades from week
  2. Calculate: Win rate by setup type
  3. Identify: Which setups >60%? Which <50%?
  4. Decision: Scale up best setups, deprecate worst setups
  5. Update: intraday_learning_database.json

MONTHLY REVIEW (End of each month):
  1. Review all intraday trades (usually 50-100)
  2. Calculate:
     - Win rate by setup type
     - Win rate by timeframe
     - Win rate by session time
     - Win rate by market regime
     - Confluence effectiveness ranking
  3. Identify: Which confluence types most predictive?
  4. Create: Regime-specific playbooks (if trending, use X setups)
  5. Update: Rules if patterns clear

QUARTERLY REVIEW (Every 90 days):
  1. Full statistical analysis (200+ trades typical)
  2. Profit factor by setup (target: >1.5 for each)
  3. Expectancy per trade (target: >$30)
  4. Determine: Am I profitable? Should I scale?
  5. Adjust: Rules, confluences, session sizing
  6. Plan: Next quarter focus

DATA SCIENCE APPROACH:
  "What signal types produce >65% win rate in choppy markets?"
  "Which confluences have highest predictive power?"
  "Which sessions are consistently profitable?"
  "Does Andy alignment improve our edge?"

  Track EVERYTHING. Let data speak. Adjust rules based on evidence.

================================================================================

================================================================================
FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

These rules are DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER.

Rule #0 (confluence) + Rule #21 (multi-TF) = High-probability entry
Rule #20 (fibonacci) + Rule #22 (session sizing) = Mechanical execution
Rule #19 (divergence) + Rule #24 (checklist) = Disciplined validation
Rule #23 (daily loss limit) = Capital preservation

FOLLOW THE SYSTEM. DATA WILL FOLLOW.

After 50 intraday trades with full compliance, you will have statistical edge.
After 100 trades, your intraday system will be a high-conviction money machine.

The edge exists. Execution discipline unlocks it.
