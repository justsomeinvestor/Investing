## Psychology & Process
- **State:** After breakdown, acknowledged need to “repair” psychology and regain boldness. Uncertainty post‑dump; observed coiling/indecision.  
- **Self‑assessment:** Stayed constructive; called it a good day.  
- **Actionables:** 
  - Continue to define risk clearly when price is within chop/triangle conditions.
  - Pre‑plan responses to repeated rejection zones (e.g., ES 6,687–6,700 and 20‑DMA band).

---

## Lessons & Playbook Updates
1. **Chop discipline:** Treat 6,650–6,700 as a distribution zone unless reclaimed with breadth confirmation; plan fade vs. breakout criteria.  
2. **DMA context:** Respect 8‑DMA and 20‑DMA as tactical stop/target rails when structure is triangular.  
3. **Post‑dump mindset:** Insert a brief reset checklist (breath, check bias, confirm levels) before next trade.

---

## Next‑Session Plan (prep checklist)
- Anchor SPX/QQQ key opens (Y/W/M), VWAP + any active AVWAPs.  
- Mark ES: 6,632 (under), 6,651 pivot, 6,687–6,692 short‑location band, 6,700 handle, 6,718–6,728 (20‑DMA).  
- Track BTC vs. 200‑DMA reactions and IBIT 59–60.  
- Watch SMH 345.85/348.20; AAPL 245–251/251–258.5 range behavior.  
- News/catalysts: GILD earnings; banks headlines; China/rare‑earths rhetoric for MP.
