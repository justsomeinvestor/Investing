### dY� Observations & Insights

- **What went well:**
  - Stayed disciplined and refrained from bottom-fishing while the system sits in AVOID territory.
  - Completed full research cycle (scrapers, summaries, market overview) to ensure situational awareness despite no trading activity.
- **What went wrong:**
  - None trade-related; the challenge remains translating the new risk signals into updated hedge sizing playbooks by Monday.
- **Unexpected Market Behavior:**
  - Magnitude of liquidation narratives (+500% mention velocity) and tariff chatter (+400%) dominated every provider feed, overwhelming usual weekend grind.
- **Personal Biases/Psychology:**
  - Mild itch to fade extremes, but reviewing breadth/VIX data helped reinforce the “hands-off” stance.

### dY'� Dashboard & Workflow Improvement Ideas

- **Data/Provider Suggestions:**
  - Pull fresh breadth internals (advance/decline, up-volume) first thing Monday to confirm if any stabilization appears.
- **Signal System Refinements:**
  - Consider flagging when dashboard composite and dailyPlanner composite diverge (11.7 vs 35.36) to force a reconciliation pass.
- **Automation Opportunities:**
  - Automate capture of ETF flow deltas into the journal template so headline numbers (e.g., +$210M) persist without manual entry.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:**
  - Add a quick “Risk Posture” badge to Journal.md so the dashboard reflects AVOID/WEAK context at a glance.

### �o. Actionable Takeaways for Tomorrow

- **Focus Areas:** Capital preservation, hedge review, monitoring macro headlines (tariffs, shutdown extensions, CPI expectations).  
- **Rules to Remember:** No new longs until breadth improves and VIX compresses; keep alerts at SPX 6,520 / BTC $110K; re-evaluate hedge sizing before Monday’s open.
