# Current Focus - Active Goals & Investigations
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27 (Session 2 - EOD)
**Session:** 2 (System Development & Infrastructure)

---

## Session 2 Completion Summary (Oct 27)

✅ **COMPLETED - Session 2 Achievements:**
1. ✅ Built comprehensive trades_ledger.json (all 5 trades documented with full context)
2. ✅ Redesigned command center dashboard (real data integration, interactive checklist)
3. ✅ Identified clear edge: Inverse ETF hedges 100% win rate, range fades 0% win rate
4. ✅ Created Rules #7 (SPY/SPXU shorts) and #17 (external advice verification)
5. ✅ Implemented pattern recognition system (compliance tracking, setup classification)
6. ✅ Set up backup and git versioning (pushed to main branch)
7. ✅ Created comprehensive EOD wrap documenting all learnings

**Key Finding:** Compliance directly correlates with wins. Oct 15 & 17 (100% compliant) = 100% wins. Oct 27 (0% compliant) = loss.

**Action:** Dashboard pre-entry checklist prevents behavioral mistakes (like Oct 27 Chris Lori trade).

## Active Goals (What We're Working On Next)

### Goal 1: Execute 1-2 Inverse ETF Hedge Trades with 100% Compliance
- [ ] Open market and verify threat assessment checklist ready
- [ ] Identify valid hedge setup (puts read or inverse ETF opportunity)
- [ ] Check ALL 6 threat assessment boxes before entry
- [ ] Record trade with full context (entry time, price, shares, stop, target)
- [ ] Exit according to plan (don't chase, don't hold overnight)

**Timeline:** Next 2 market sessions (Oct 28, Oct 29, or after FOMC)
**Success Criteria:** 1-2 trades executed, 100% compliance, positive P/L

**Rationale:** Inverse ETF hedges have proven 100% win rate (2/2). This is your EDGE. Build confidence here.

---

### Goal 2: Improve Compliance from 40% to 80%+
- [ ] Use dashboard pre-entry checklist for EVERY trade
- [ ] Don't click entry button until all 6 items checked
- [ ] Track compliance % after each trade (should be 100%)
- [ ] Analyze any violations immediately
- [ ] Log lessons to trades_ledger.json

**Timeline:** Every session
**Success Criteria:** 80%+ compliance over next 10 trades (vs 40% current)

**Rationale:** Data shows 100% compliance trades win, violations lose. Compliance IS the opportunity.

---

### Goal 3: Avoid Range Fades Until Structure Improves
- [ ] Don't enter fade setups in choppy markets (signal <50)
- [ ] Wait for clear trend structure or support/resistance breaks
- [ ] If fading, require: C+R confirmation, EMA filter, volume 1.3×, ADD confirming
- [ ] Track range fade attempts and outcomes

**Timeline:** Ongoing
**Success Criteria:** 0 losses to range fades (vs 0% win rate historically)

**Rationale:** Range fades 0/2 = clear weakness. Skip until proven edge develops.

---

### Goal 4: Track Progress Toward $2,500 Monthly Goal
- [ ] Daily: Check dashboard for YTD and daily rate
- [ ] Weekly: Calculate days remaining vs $ remaining
- [ ] After each trade: Update trades_ledger.json with P/L impact
- [ ] Identify what setup types move needle (hedges +$281/2 trades = strongest)

**Timeline:** Daily tracking through end of October
**Success Criteria:** Hit $2,500 by Oct 31 (need ~$1,221 more = $136/day for 9 days)

---

## Open Investigations (Research In Progress)

### Investigation 1: FOMC Oct 29 Positioning Strategy
**Question:** What's the optimal entry/exit plan for both dovish and hawkish scenarios?

**Current Research:**
- Dovish case: +3-5% equity rally, +5-8% BTC move (95%+ probability)
- Hawkish case: Retest lows with quick recovery expected (10% probability)
- Breadth thrust needed post-FOMC to confirm (>70% up-volume)
- VIX volatility window ±5 points likely

**Next Steps:**
- Define specific entry triggers for both scenarios
- Pre-plan hedging adjustments post-FOMC
- Monitor breadth daily leading up to announcement

---

### Investigation 2: Optimal Entry Zones & Risk Definitions
**Question:** Are our entry zones (SPX $6,655-6,679, BTC $110K-$108K) actually generating quality setups?

**Current Research:**
- SPX support validated: 50-day MA holding at $6,628
- Breadth A/D 1.69 shows institutional support holding
- BTC $110K-$108K = accumulation zone based on Fear & Greed 40 = historical 80%+ 3-month win rate
- Need breadth confirmation before aggressive deployment

**Next Steps:**
- Execute first entries at defined zones
- Track execution quality vs planned levels
- Adjust zones based on actual price action

---

### Investigation 3: Rule Effectiveness - Which Rules Actually Work?
**Question:** Which of our 16 rules have highest impact on win rate/discipline?

**Current Research:**
- Rules extracted from Oct 9-17 (5 trades, ~60% compliance estimated)
- Best setup: Tactical entries respecting chop (SOLZ +$100)
- Worst setup: Entries without trigger confluence (NVDA -$100)
- Hypothesis: Rules that require ALL criteria met (like short trigger rule #7) are more reliable

**Next Steps:**
- Implement compliance tracking for each rule
- Calculate rule effectiveness over next 10-20 trades
- Deprecate low-effectiveness rules, emphasize high-effectiveness rules

---

### Investigation 4: Personal Trading Psychology Patterns
**Question:** What behavioral patterns affect trading performance?

**Current Observations (from journals):**
- Oct 13: Entered without confluence (breach of discipline - signal: over-eagerness)
- Oct 14: Early exit saved capital (sign of caution in uncertain structure)
- Oct 15: Clean trigger stack execution (high-quality execution day)
- Oct 17: Patient in chop (good discipline, avoided "forcing it")

**Hypothesis:** Discipline improves when structure is clear. When structure is ambiguous (chop), discipline tends to break.

**Next Steps:**
- Track emotional state during each trade
- Note when rules are followed vs broken
- Identify if breakdowns correlate with specific market conditions

---

## Current Market Stance

### Primary Thesis
**Contrarian inflection, NOT weakness**
- Signal 45.5/100 MODERATE reflects prudent caution before FOMC binary
- Fear & Greed 40 = historically strong entry zone (80%+ win rate for 3-month forward)
- Institutional accumulation documented (Saylor +390 BTC, Trump miners +1.4K BTC)
- Market structure = accumulation (not distribution)

### Current Positioning
- **Cash:** 100% (ready for deployment)
- **Target allocation:** 35% equities, 20% crypto, 10% hedges, 35% cash

### Key Levels to Watch
- **SPX:** Support $6,655.9 (strong), resistance $6,927.5 (medium)
- **BTC:** Support $110.3K (medium), $108.1K (strong), resistance $116K (whale wall)
- **QQQ:** Support $602 (medium), resistance $630+ (on breadth thrust)
- **Breadth:** Need >70% up-volume day to confirm bullish thrust

### Catalysts & Timeline
- **TODAY (Oct 27):** Durable Goods, housing data
- **OCT 28:** Housing Price Index, Consumer Confidence
- **OCT 29 (CRITICAL):** FOMC Rate Decision 18:00 ET, Press Conference 18:30 ET
- **OCT 30:** GDP, Core PCE, Jobless Claims
- **OCT 31:** Core PCE, Employment Cost Index, Chicago PMI

## Recent Lessons (Last 7 Days - UPDATED OCT 27)

### Oct 27 - External Advice Without Verification (Today)
**Lesson:** Following someone else's recommendation (Chris from Simpler Trading: "9-day EMA mean reversion") without running OUR threat assessment = automatic loss.

**What happened:**
- Heard Chris say "market should come back to 9-day EMA"
- Belief in mean reversion was strong
- Entered SPXU short @ 12.61, exited @ 12.54
- Loss: -$21 (small, but 0% rule compliance)
- Skipped: C+R confirmation, EMA filter, ADD confirmation, volume check, etc.

**Rule Created:**
**NEW RULE #17:** "Never enter on external tip without verifying against trigger checklist. External advice ≠ OUR thesis. All confluence criteria must be met REGARDLESS of advisor credibility."

**Application:**
- Other people's good ideas can be trap doors if WE don't verify them
- Respect the process (threat assessment + rule check) more than respect the advisor
- "Chris said so" is not a valid entry reason

**Pattern Recognition:**
This is the EXACT pattern identified in continuity: Over-eagerness in uncertain structure. Market was choppy, structure unclear, Chris's suggestion felt like clarity → you jumped.

## Previous Lessons (Last 7 Days)

### Oct 17 - Discipline Win
**Lesson:** Patience in chop pays off. Stayed in cash during ES 6,650-6,700 box, only captured tactical SOLZ long (+$100).
**Rule:** Respect chop structure. Don't force trades during range consolidation.
**Application:** When breadth/structure unclear, size down or stay in cash.

---

### Oct 15 - Clean Execution
**Lesson:** Following trigger stack cleanly = better results. SPXU trade (round-trip, +$181) executed with starter + adds.
**Rule:** Starter position, then add on confirmation, then exit on signal.
**Application:** Pre-plan position builds. Don't wing it mid-trade.

---

### Oct 14 - Structure Matters
**Lesson:** SPY short attempt failed because market didn't provide C+R (close+retest) confirmation.
**Rule:** Require C+R before fading resistance. Don't front-run structural failures.
**Application:** Wait for confirmation bars. Don't anticipate breakdowns.

---

### Oct 13 - Trigger Confluence Critical
**Lesson:** Entered NVDA short without checking: monthly/weekly/daily mids, AVWAP, gamma flip, IB levels, volume. Lost -$100.
**Rule:** No entries without trigger confluence. Check ALL confluence factors.
**Application:** Create pre-entry checklist. Don't enter until ALL criteria met.

---

### Oct 11 - Respect Signal Tier
**Lesson:** System at WEAK/AVOID. Stayed in cash. Discipline paid off as risks materialized.
**Rule:** WEAK signal = no new longs. Keep hedges. Watch for stabilization (breadth >70%).
**Application:** Honor the signal tier. Don't fight the system.

---

## Rules Recently Created

All rules extracted from Oct 9-17 journals. **16 rules total**, organized by category:

### High-Priority Rules (Most Violations = Most Important)
1. **No entries without trigger confluence** (NVDA -$100 violation Oct 13)
2. **C+R confirmation required** (SPY short failed Oct 14)
3. **Require ALL short criteria met** (SPY -$15 violation Oct 14)
4. **Respect signal tier** (WEAK signal = no new longs)
5. **Volume confirmation 1.3×** (Multiple violations)

### Medium-Priority Rules
- QQQ filter for NVDA shorts (< 600.9 or rejection from 603.5)
- EMA posture (200 EMA must be falling for shorts)
- Time management (no last 15 min initiations)
- Stop placement (pre-set stops enforce discipline)

### Supporting Rules
- VIX re-entry flag management
- DXY tracking as risk indicator
- Counter-trend size reduction
- Breadth-driven trading bias
- Chop structure respect

## Questions for Future Wingman

1. **How is compliance tracking working?** Are we getting real-time rule checks, or is it manual?

2. **What's our actual edge right now?** Based on first 5-10 trades, which setups win most?

3. **Is the FOMC thesis proving correct?** Did we nail the entry zones, or do we need to adjust?

4. **Which rules are we actually following?** Which ones keep getting violated (and should we reconsider)?

5. **How is the market thesis evolving?** Is the contrarian inflection thesis holding, or has structure changed?

**Status:** Active, real-time updates as trading occurs.
**Next Review:** End of Session 1 (today)
