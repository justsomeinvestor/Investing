## Personal Psychology Notes (From Your History)

### What Works For You
✅ **Clear structure** = You execute cleanly (Oct 15 SPXU, Oct 17 SOLZ)
✅ **Patient waiting** = You catch good setups (Oct 17 discipline in chop)
✅ **Full confluence** = You reduce mistakes (follow the checklist)
✅ **Cash positions** = You stay calm and wait (Oct 11 defense paid off)

### What Breaks You
❌ **Ambiguous structure** = You get impatient (Oct 13, Oct 14)
❌ **Choppy conditions** = You "need to do something" (resist this urge)
❌ **Skipped checklist** = You lose money (NVDA -$100, SPY -$15)
❌ **Pressure to trade** = You make bad entries (wait for CLEAR setups)

**Your Pattern:** You're excellent when the setup is OBVIOUS. When it's not obvious, you're worse. So: **Only trade when structure is crystal clear.**
