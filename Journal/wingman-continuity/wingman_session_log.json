Pilot/Wingman monitored post-FOMC \"sell the news\" reversal setup: SPX at 168% Fib exhaustion, breadth divergence (SPY/QQQ weak vs mega-caps rallying), narrow leadership breaking. Exited Trade #7 at market close (12:38 PM before FOMC) at +$60 profit. Risk management decision: Avoid overnight gap risk on binary event. Morning extension thesis VINDICATED by post-FOMC structure.
