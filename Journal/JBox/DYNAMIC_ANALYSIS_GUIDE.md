# Dynamic Analysis Panel - Command Center Guide

**Updated:** 2025-10-19
**Feature:** Live analysis results display with pin-to-persist functionality

---

## Overview

The Command Center now features a **Dynamic Analysis Panel** that:
- âœ… Displays analysis results in real-time
- âœ… Shows all components (TA, context, sentiment, volume, seasonality)
- âœ… Displays entry/stop/target levels
- âœ… PIN results to keep them on screen
- âœ… Persists pinned analyses across page reloads (localStorage)
- âœ… Auto-scrolls to analysis when results arrive

---

## How It Works

### 1. Running an Analysis

**In Conversation with Wingman:**
```
"wingman, analyze SPY"
```

**Result:**
- Analysis completes
- Dynamic panel appears (if not already visible)
- All data fills in automatically
- Panel auto-scrolls into view

### 2. Panel Contents

The analysis panel displays:

**Header Section:**
- Ticker name (large, blue)
- Signal (BUY/WAIT/AVOID - green if BUY)
- Probability score (0-100)

**Component Breakdown:**
- Technical Analysis (TA)
- Market Context
- Sentiment
- Volume
- Seasonality

**Trade Levels:**
- Entry price (blue)
- Stop price (red)
- Target price (green)
- Risk:Reward ratio (yellow)

**Additional Info:**
- Full reasoning/analysis narrative
- Data source (cache/live_api/simulated)
- Confidence level
- Position size (shares)

### 3. PIN Button - Keep Results On Screen

**Click PIN Button:**
- Button turns green: "ðŸ“Œ PINNED"
- Analysis saved to browser storage
- Result persists across page reloads
- Close button becomes inactive (protected)

**To Unpin:**
- Click PIN button again (turns back to yellow: "ðŸ“Œ PIN")
- Analysis can now be closed
- Storage is cleared

### 4. CLOSE Button

**Click CLOSE Button:**
- If NOT pinned: Panel closes/hides
- If pinned: Alert appears "Analysis is pinned. Click PIN to unpin before closing."

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Quick Analysis
```
User: "wingman, analyze NVDA"
â†’ Panel displays with NVDA analysis
â†’ User reviews
â†’ User closes (not needed after)
```

### Scenario 2: Compare Multiple Tickers
```
User: "wingman, analyze NVDA"
â†’ Panel shows NVDA
User: PIN analysis
â†’ Analysis stays on screen
User: "wingman, analyze TSLA"
â†’ New analysis displayed below/beside
User: Compare both visually
```

### Scenario 3: Reference During Trading
```
User: "wingman, analyze SPY"
â†’ PIN analysis
â†’ SPY setup stays visible all session
â†’ Refer back while trading
â†’ Close at end of day
```

### Scenario 4: Multi-Day Reference
```
User: "wingman, analyze QQQ" (Monday)
â†’ PIN analysis
â†’ Browser closes
User: Reopens site (Tuesday)
â†’ PINNED analysis still there!
â†’ Can refer back to Monday's analysis
```

## Integration with Analysis Command

**How Results Get to Panel:**

1. User says: "wingman, analyze SPY"
2. Backend runs analysis
3. Returns JSON result
4. Frontend calls: `displayAnalysis(analysisResult)`
5. Panel populates and shows

**Expected JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "ticker": "SPY",
  "signal": "BUY",
  "probability_score": 71.5,
  "confidence": "GOOD",
  "data_source": "cache",
  "component_scores": {
    "technical_analysis": 80.0,
    "market_context": 55.0,
    "sentiment": 40.0,
    "volume": 50.0,
    "seasonality": 55.0
  },
  "levels": {
    "entry": 425.30,

## Browser Compatibility

- Works on Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge
- Requires localStorage support (all modern browsers)
- Responsive design (adapts to mobile)

## Tips & Tricks

**Multiple Analyses:**

- PIN before getting new analysis if you want to compare
- Can analyze different tickers one by one and PIN each

**Long Analysis Session:**
- PIN your best setups throughout the day
- Close others to keep dashboard clean
- Review all pinned analyses at end of day

**Archive Results:**
- PIN analysis before page refresh
- Analysis persists in localStorage
- Perfect for review next session

---

## Troubleshooting

**Panel not showing?**
- Check if it's been closed without data
- Refresh page to reset
- Run new analysis

**PIN not working?**
- Try clicking PIN again
- Check browser console for JS errors
- Clear localStorage and try again

**Analysis shows old data?**
- Unpin current analysis
- Run fresh analysis
- Confirm data source is "cache" or "live_api"
